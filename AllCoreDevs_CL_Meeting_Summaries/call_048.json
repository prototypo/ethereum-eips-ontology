    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 048",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for the Beacon Chain. The proposal aims to reduce gas costs by allowing clients to verify only a subset of blocks instead of all transactions. After thorough discussion, the team decided to move forward with implementing this feature in Ethereum 2.0.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several were addressed during the call. Notably, **the Merge testnet** is experiencing intermittent connectivity problems due to an issue with the network's gossip protocol. The developers are working on a fix, which should be implemented soon. Additionally, some clients reported encountering difficulties when syncing with the Beacon Chain.\n\nThe development milestones and testing updates highlighted several key areas of progress. The team has made significant strides in implementing **Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1**, with all major client implementations now supporting this phase. Testing for Phase 2 is ongoing, but developers are facing challenges related to data availability sampling (as mentioned earlier). To address these issues, the testing schedule will be adjusted accordingly.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed during the call. **Lighthouse** and **Nethermind** have made notable advancements in implementing EIP-4848, while other clients continue to work on integrating this feature. The team is working closely together to ensure a smooth transition between phases.\n\nAction items for upcoming deadlines include finalizing the implementation of data availability sampling (EIP-4848) by **April 15th** and completing Phase 2 testing within the next two weeks."
