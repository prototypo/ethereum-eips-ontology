After a thorough discussion, it was decided to proceed with implementing this protocol upgrade in Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported by clients and addressed during the call. Notably, **technical issues and proposed solutions** included resolving an issue affecting Beacon Chain block proposers' performance optimization. The team also discussed a potential fix for a gas limit-related problem in EVM execution. These discussions will continue to ensure smooth network operations.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, the meeting highlighted progress toward implementing Phase 1.5's final components. **Development milestones** include completing the implementation of Proto-Danksharding (EIP-4848) by Q2 2023. Testing efforts are ongoing, with a focus on ensuring seamless integration between Beacon Chain and Shard Chains.\n\nThe client implementation progress was also discussed during the call. Notably, Lighthouse has made significant strides in implementing Phase 1.5 components, while Nimbus is working to address outstanding issues related to Proto-Danksharding's execution environment. **Client implementation** updates will continue to be a key focus area for future meetings.\n\nAction items and upcoming deadlines were also discussed during the call. The team agreed on several tasks, including finalizing EIP-4848 documentation by March 15th and conducting thorough testing of Phase 1.5 components before its scheduled deployment in Q2 2023."
