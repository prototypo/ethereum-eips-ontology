    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 026",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' consensus layer meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4846**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for the Beacon Chain. The proposal aims to reduce gas costs by allowing clients to sample blocks instead of verifying all transactions. After thorough discussion, it was decided that the implementation will proceed as planned.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several were reported during the meeting. Notably, a bug in **Beacon Node 0.7** caused some nodes to become stuck due to an incorrect handling of attestations. The developers agreed on a fix for this issue and are working towards releasing Beacon Node 1.0 soon.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates highlighted several key achievements. The team has made significant progress with the implementation of **Ethereum 2.0's Phase 3**, which includes the introduction of sharding. Testing is ongoing, but some concerns were raised regarding the performance impact on clients. Additionally, a new version of the **Lighthouse client** (version 5.1) was released to address several issues and improve overall stability.\n\nClient implementation progress showed that most major clients are making good headway with their implementations. However, there is still work required for some features like sharding. Action items assigned during the meeting include finalizing EIP-4846's specification by **March 15th** and conducting thorough testing of Phase 3 before its release.\n\nOverall, this meeting demonstrated significant progress towards Ethereum 2.0's development milestones while also addressing pressing technical issues."
