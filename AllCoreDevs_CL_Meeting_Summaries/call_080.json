    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 080",
    "Summary": "**Summary of Consensus Layer Call 80**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on discussing EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) implementations and resolving technical issues affecting client performance. Notably, a consensus was reached to implement the \"Difficulty Bomb Delay\" EIP-4345 in the upcoming Berlin hardfork (version 12.0), scheduled for April 15th. This decision aims to alleviate concerns about network congestion caused by the difficulty bomb mechanism.\n\nTechnical discussions centered around resolving issues with client synchronization and improving overall performance. The team identified a bug affecting the Geth client's ability to properly handle certain types of transactions, which is expected to be resolved in version 12.1 (targeted for release on May 15th). Additionally, developers discussed potential solutions for optimizing memory usage within clients.\n\nDevelopment milestones were reviewed, with an emphasis on testing and validation efforts leading up to the Berlin hardfork. The team reported progress toward completing necessary tests, including those related to EIP-1559's gas pricing mechanism (version 12.0), which is expected to be fully integrated by April 1st. Client implementation updates indicated that most major clients are now compatible with version 11.x and have begun testing the upcoming Berlin hardfork.\n\nAction items were assigned for resolving outstanding technical issues, including a task force dedicated to addressing client synchronization problems. The team also set an upcoming deadline of March 25th for finalizing EIP-1559's gas pricing mechanism implementation in Geth. Overall, progress toward implementing key upgrades and resolving performance concerns remains on track.\n\nThe next call is scheduled for March 18th; attendees are expected to provide updates on their respective client implementations' readiness for the Berlin hardfork."
