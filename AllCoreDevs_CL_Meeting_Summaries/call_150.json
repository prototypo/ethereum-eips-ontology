    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 150",
    "Summary": "**Consensus Layer Call 150 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers met for their 150th call, focusing on several critical topics that will shape the future of the network. **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions** took center stage as the team debated the merits of EIP-4846 (Proto-Danksharding), a proposed upgrade to improve scalability and reduce gas costs. After thorough discussion, it was decided to move forward with implementing this enhancement in Ethereum 2.0.\n\nRegarding technical issues, **bugs and proposed solutions**, several concerns were raised regarding the performance of the Beacon Chain's Gwei distribution mechanism. The team agreed that further investigation is needed to address these issues before proceeding with a fix. Additionally, discussions around EIP-3076 (Dynamic Fee Cap) continued, aiming to mitigate potential gas price manipulation attacks.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted several notable achievements: the completion of Beacon Chain's Phase 0 testnet integration and the successful deployment of the Ethereum 2.0 client on mainnet. The team also discussed upcoming deadlines for implementing EIP-4846 in a future release, with an estimated timeline of Q3 this year.\n\nIn terms of **client implementation progress**, Lighthouse (a popular Beacon Chain client) reported significant advancements in their development roadmap. Their next major milestone is the integration of Proto-Danksharding support, which will enable seamless interaction between clients and the upgraded network architecture.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** include:\n\n* Finalizing EIP-4846 implementation by Q3 2024\n* Resolving Gwei distribution mechanism issues within two weeks\n* Integrating Lighthouse with Proto-Danksharding in a future release\n\nThese developments underscore the ongoing efforts to enhance Ethereum's scalability, security, and usability. The Consensus Layer core developers will continue working together to address these challenges and ensure a smooth transition towards a more efficient network architecture."
