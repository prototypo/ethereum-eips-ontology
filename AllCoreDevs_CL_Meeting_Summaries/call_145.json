    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 145",
    "Summary": "**Consensus Layer Call 145 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers met for call number 145, focusing on several critical topics that impact the network's development and stability.\n\n**Protocol Decisions and EIP Discussions**\nOne of the primary discussions centered around EIP-4846 (Proto-Danksharding), which aims to improve scalability by reducing gas costs. The team agreed to move forward with implementing this proposal in a future release, targeting Ethereum 2.0 version 1.3. Additionally, they discussed and refined other proposals related to sharding and data availability.\n\n**Technical Issues, Bugs, and Proposed Solutions**\nThe meeting highlighted ongoing efforts to address technical issues affecting the network's performance. Specifically, developers are working on resolving a bug in the Beacon Chain that causes inconsistencies between block numbers and epochs. A proposed solution involves updating the chain's state transition function to improve synchronization.\n\n**Development Milestones and Testing Updates**\nRegarding development milestones, the team is making progress toward implementing the \"Bellatrix\" upgrade (Ethereum 2.0 version 1.3), which will introduce several key improvements, including improved sharding capabilities. In terms of testing updates, developers are conducting thorough reviews to ensure that all changes meet the required standards.\n\n**Client Implementation Progress**\nSeveral clients have made significant progress in implementing the upcoming upgrades and proposals discussed during the meeting. For instance, Lighthouse has successfully integrated EIP-4846 into its codebase, while Prysm is working on resolving outstanding issues related to sharding. The team emphasized the importance of continued collaboration among client developers to ensure a smooth transition.\n\n**Action Items and Upcoming Deadlines**\nThe call concluded with several action items assigned to specific teams or individuals, including updating documentation for EIP-4846 and reviewing code changes for Bellatrix. Key deadlines include completing the Beacon Chain bug fix by the end of Q2 2023 and finalizing client implementations before the scheduled upgrade release in mid-July."
