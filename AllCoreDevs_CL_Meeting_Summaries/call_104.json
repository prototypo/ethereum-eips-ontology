    "Summary": "**Consensus Layer Call 104 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers met for call number 104, focusing on several critical topics that will shape the future of the network. **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions** took center stage as the team debated the implementation details of EIP-4848 (Proto-Danksharding), a significant upgrade aimed at improving scalability. The discussion centered around the optimal gas pricing model for this new protocol, with some developers advocating for a more aggressive approach to incentivize adoption.\n\nIn terms of **technical issues and bugs**, several clients reported encountering problems related to the recent merge transition. Specifically, Geth 1.10.x users experienced difficulties due to an incorrect implementation of the `geth --syncmode` flag. The team agreed on implementing fixes for these issues in upcoming releases. Notably, Prysmatic Labs' client has already addressed this problem with their latest version (v2.0.3).\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted several notable achievements. The Ethereum 1.x testnet is now live, allowing developers to experiment with the new protocol features before mainnet deployment. Additionally, a comprehensive security audit of EIP-4848 has been initiated by Trail of Bits.\n\nRegarding **client implementation progress**, most clients are on track to support Proto-Danksharding in their upcoming releases (e.g., Geth 1.11.x and Prysm v2.0.4). However, some concerns were raised about the potential impact of this upgrade on network congestion during its initial deployment phase.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** include finalizing EIP-4848's implementation details by call number 105 (within two weeks) to ensure a smooth transition for mainnet deployment in Q2."
