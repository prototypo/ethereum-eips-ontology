    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 084",
    "Summary": "**Summary of Consensus Layer Call 84**\n\nThe primary focus area for this call was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team discussed the upcoming merge with Beacon Chain (version v1.2). The consensus is to proceed with a \"merge\" approach, which will combine the existing Ethereum mainnet with the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Beacon Chain. This decision aims to improve scalability, security, and energy efficiency.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, several topics were addressed: 1) The team is working on resolving a critical issue related to gas limit adjustments in the PoW-to-PoS transition phase; 2) A bug was identified in the implementation of the \"difficulty bomb\" mechanism, which will be fixed soon. Additionally, discussions around EIP-4844 (Data Availability Sampling), aimed at improving scalability through data availability sampling, are ongoing.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates**: The team is on track to complete the merge by mid-June 2023, with a focus on thorough testing of all components involved in the transition process. A comprehensive test plan has been developed, covering various scenarios and edge cases.\n\nRegarding **Client implementation progress**, most clients are making good progress towards implementing the necessary changes for the merge. However, some minor issues were reported by certain client teams that will be addressed before the final release.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines**: The team agreed to finalize all outstanding EIPs related to the merge within two weeks (by May 15th). Additionally, a detailed test plan review is scheduled for next week's call."
