    "Summary": "The CL team is working on implementing the Bellatrix upgrade. The EL team has been testing and validating the implementation of the EIP-4844 sharding proposal.\n\nThere are no new deadlines mentioned for mainnet or devnet deployment. However, it's noted that there will be a testnet launch soon to validate the EIP-4844 implementation before moving forward with Bellatrix on mainnet.\n\nThe CL team is still working through some issues related to the merge fork choice rule and the inclusion of empty blocks in the chain. The EL team has been making progress on implementing the sharding proposal, but there are still some open questions regarding its interaction with other components of the protocol.\n\nOverall, both teams seem to be progressing steadily towards their goals, although there is still work to be done before mainnet deployment can occur."
