    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 112",
    "Summary": "**Consensus Layer Call 112 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers met for call number 112, focusing on several critical topics that will shape the future of the network. **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions** took center stage as the team reviewed proposals to enhance the Beacon Chain's efficiency and scalability.\n\nNotably, a discussion around EIP-4846 (Base Fee Upgrade) gained significant attention. This proposal aims to improve gas metering by introducing a new type of transaction that can be processed more efficiently on the network. The developers agreed to move forward with implementing this upgrade in Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5, which is expected to increase throughput and reduce congestion.\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were also addressed during the call. A critical bug affecting the Beacon Chain's proposer selection process was identified and a fix has been implemented for testing purposes. The team acknowledged that further validation is required before deploying this patch in production environments.\n\nRegarding **development milestones and testing updates**, it was reported that Phase 1.5 development progress remains on track, with several clients actively contributing to the effort. Notably, Lighthouse (version 4.0) has successfully completed a series of integration tests against other client implementations. The team is optimistic about meeting their target timeline for releasing this phase.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** were also discussed during the call. Key takeaways include:\n\n* Finalizing EIP-4846 implementation by Q2 2023\n* Completing Phase 1.5 testing within the next two months\n* Reviewing client implementations to ensure compatibility with Beacon Chain upgrades\n\nOverall, this meeting highlighted significant progress toward enhancing Ethereum's scalability and efficiency while emphasizing ongoing efforts to address technical challenges and improve network performance."
