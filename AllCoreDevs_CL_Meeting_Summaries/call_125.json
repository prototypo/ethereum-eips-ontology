    "Summary": "**Summary of Consensus Layer Meeting 125**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team discussed the implementation details of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which aims to increase block gas limit by introducing a new data structure called \"sharding\". The proposal has been updated to version 2.0, addressing concerns raised during previous meetings.\n\n**Technical issues and proposed solutions** were also extensively covered in this meeting. A critical bug was identified in the sharding implementation of Goerli testnet (version v1.10.4), which could lead to data corruption if not addressed promptly. The team agreed on a fix for this issue, with an estimated resolution timeline of 2-3 weeks.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** were also discussed during the meeting. The sharding implementation is progressing as planned, with version v1.11.0 expected to be released soon (targeting mid-January). Testing has been ongoing on Goerli testnet, which will serve as a precursor for mainnet deployment.\n\nRegarding **client implementation progress**, Lighthouse and Nimbus clients are both making good strides in implementing sharding functionality. However, the team noted that there is still work required to ensure seamless integration with other components of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** were also outlined during this meeting. The next major milestone for EIP-4844 implementation will be a testnet deployment on Goerli (targeting late January). Additionally, regular testing sessions have been scheduled every two weeks to monitor progress and address any emerging issues."
