    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 050",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for the Beacon Chain. The discussion centered around its potential impact on scalability and gas costs.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported in various clients, including Prysm (version 1.0.6) and Lighthouse (version v5.2.3). A proposed solution was discussed for a known issue affecting the `get_block_hash` function in Beacon Chain nodes. The developers also touched upon **Ethereum 2.0's** ongoing testing phase, with an update on the status of testnets.\n\nClient implementation progress showed that several clients are nearing completion or have already reached milestones. For instance, Prysm has successfully implemented EIP-4848 and is preparing for its release in version 1.1. Lighthouse developers reported significant advancements towards implementing data availability sampling as well. The meeting highlighted the importance of continued collaboration among client teams to ensure a unified implementation.\n\nAction items were assigned to several team members regarding documentation, testing, and code reviews. Notably, an upcoming deadline was set for **Ethereum 2.0's** testnet deployment (targeting Q3), which will be crucial in evaluating the consensus layer's readiness for mainnet launch. Overall, this meeting underscored the ongoing efforts to refine Ethereum 2.0's protocol and ensure a smooth transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake."
