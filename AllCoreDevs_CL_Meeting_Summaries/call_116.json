    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 116",
    "Summary": "**Consensus Layer Call 116 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers met for call number 116, focusing on several critical topics that will shape the future of the network. **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions** took center stage as the team debated the implementation details of EIP-4848 (Proto-Danksharding), a key upgrade aimed at improving scalability. After thorough discussion, it was decided to proceed with implementing the protocol change in Ethereum 2.0's Bellatrix phase.\n\nRegarding **technical issues and bugs**, several concerns were raised regarding the performance of the Beacon Chain under high load conditions. The team proposed solutions involving adjustments to gas limits and block times, which will be further explored before implementation. Additionally, a bug affecting the handling of attestations was identified and assigned for resolution by an upcoming deadline.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted significant progress on implementing EIP-4848 in various client implementations (e.g., Lighthouse v5.2.0). The team also discussed ongoing efforts to improve test coverage and automate validation processes, aiming to enhance the overall robustness of the network.\n\nIn terms of **client implementation progress**, several clients reported advancements toward supporting Proto-Danksharding, with some already implementing key components. Notably, Lighthouse has made significant strides in this area, while Prysm is working on integrating EIP-4848 support into its upcoming v2.0 release.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** include resolving the identified bug affecting attestations by Call 117 (within a week) and finalizing Proto-Danksharding implementation details for Bellatrix phase deployment in Q3 this year. The team will reconvene to review progress, address any concerns, and set further milestones toward achieving Ethereum's scalability goals."
