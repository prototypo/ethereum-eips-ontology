    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 110",
    "Summary": "**Consensus Layer Call 110 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers met for call number 110, focusing on several critical topics that will shape the future of the network. **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions** took center stage as the team debated the merits of EIP-4846 (Proto-Danksharding), a proposed upgrade to improve scalability and reduce gas costs. After thorough discussion, it was decided to move forward with implementing this enhancement in Ethereum 2.0.\n\nRegarding technical issues, **bugs, and proposed solutions**, several concerns were raised regarding the performance of the Beacon Chain's Gwei distribution mechanism. Developers agreed on a plan to address these issues through code refactoring and testing. Additionally, discussions around EIP-3076 (Dynamic Fee Cap) continued, with developers working towards resolving outstanding technical hurdles.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted significant progress in implementing Ethereum 2.0 features. The team reported that the Beacon Chain's Phase 1 implementation is nearing completion, with a planned launch date set for Q3 this year. Testing efforts are also underway to ensure seamless integration of new upgrades.\n\nIn terms of **client implementation progress**, Lighthouse and Prysm clients have made notable strides in implementing EIP-4846 features. However, some concerns were raised regarding the compatibility between these implementations and other client versions. The team agreed on a plan for thorough testing and validation before deployment.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** include finalizing EIP-3076 implementation by the end of Q2 and completing Phase 1 Beacon Chain launch preparations within the next quarter. These milestones will be crucial in driving Ethereum's continued growth and adoption."
