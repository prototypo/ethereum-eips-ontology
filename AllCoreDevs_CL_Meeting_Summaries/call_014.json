    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 014",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for the Beacon Chain. The proposal aims to reduce gas costs by allowing clients to sample blocks instead of verifying all transactions. After thorough discussion, it was decided that EIP-4848 will be implemented in Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, a critical **bug fix** for the `get_block_hash` function was discussed. The issue caused inconsistencies between Beacon Chain block hashes and those reported by clients. A proposed solution has been submitted to address this problem. Additionally, concerns were raised about potential performance degradation due to an increase in memory usage.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates highlighted progress toward **Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5**, with a focus on implementing EIP-4848 and other related features. Testing is ongoing for the proposed changes, aiming to ensure seamless integration into the Beacon Chain. Client implementation progress was also discussed, noting that several clients are actively working towards supporting EIP-4848.\n\nAction items assigned during the meeting include submitting a formal proposal for EIP-4848's implementation timeline and coordinating with client developers on testing schedules. The next call is scheduled to review these updates and discuss any further concerns or issues arising from ongoing development efforts."
