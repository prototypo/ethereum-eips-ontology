    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 096",
    "Summary": "**Summary of MEETING_NUM**\n\nThe Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers met to discuss several critical topics affecting the protocol's development and implementation. The primary focus was on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team reviewed proposals for upcoming changes, including EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) 4844, which aims to increase block gas limit by up to 30%. This proposal has sparked debate among developers regarding its potential impact on network congestion.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, several concerns were raised about the stability of certain client implementations. Specifically, a bug in the Geth (Go Ethereum) client was identified that could lead to data corruption under specific conditions. The team agreed to prioritize fixing this issue as soon as possible. Additionally, discussions centered around optimizing memory usage within clients.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted progress toward implementing sharding, with several testnets already running on the Beacon Chain (version 1.2). However, some developers expressed concerns about the pace of development, citing potential delays in meeting previously set deadlines for mainnet deployment. To mitigate these risks, a revised timeline has been proposed.\n\nIn terms of **Client implementation progress**, most clients are now aligned with version 0.12.x or higher, which includes several bug fixes and performance enhancements. However, some developers noted that certain features still require further testing before they can be considered stable for production use.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** include finalizing the EIP4844 proposal by MEETING_NUM+1, addressing outstanding technical issues in client implementations, and revisiting development timelines to ensure alignment with projected milestones."
