    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 071",
    "Summary": "**Summary of Consensus Layer Call 71**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4846**, which proposes to introduce \"blobs\" as an efficient way to store data in transactions. The discussion centered around the potential benefits and drawbacks of this proposal, including its impact on gas costs and scalability.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported across various clients, including Go-Ethereum (Geth) and Nethermind. A proposed solution for one such bug involved updating the `keccak256` function to use a more efficient algorithm. The developers also discussed potential solutions for mitigating the effects of \"reorgs\" on client performance.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, it was noted that **Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1** is nearing completion, with several clients having successfully completed their respective testnets. However, some concerns were raised regarding the potential for a delay in the transition to Phase 2 due to ongoing technical issues.\n\nClient implementation progress varied across different teams, but Go-Ethereum (Geth) and Nethermind reported significant advancements towards implementing EIP-4846. The developers also discussed plans for **upcoming testing phases**, including a focus on stress-testing client performance under various scenarios.\n\nAction items assigned during the call included reviewing and refining proposals related to EIP-4846, as well as coordinating efforts among clients to address ongoing technical issues. Notably, several deadlines were set for completion of specific tasks, with some milestones expected within **the next two weeks**."
