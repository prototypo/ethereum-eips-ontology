    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 030",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4848, which aims to improve data availability for rollups by introducing a new type of transaction called \"blobs.\" The discussion centered around the potential benefits and drawbacks of this proposal. After thorough deliberation, it was decided that EIP-4848 will be implemented in Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5.\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were also a key topic during the meeting. A critical bug affecting the Beacon Chain's liveness was identified and addressed by implementing an emergency fix to prevent potential network instability. Additionally, discussions around improving the performance of the Ethereum 2.0 client, Lighthouse, highlighted ongoing efforts to optimize its codebase.\n\nRegarding **development milestones and testing updates**, it was announced that Phase 1.5 is on track for a mid-2023 release, with significant progress made in implementing EIP-4848 and other critical features. Testing has been conducted using the Prysm client, which reported no major issues during recent trials.\n\n**Client implementation progress** showed Lighthouse leading the pack, having successfully implemented most of Phase 1.5's requirements. Other clients like Teku and Nethermind are also making steady strides in catching up with Lighthouse's development pace.\n\nLastly, **action items and upcoming deadlines** were outlined for each client to ensure a unified effort towards meeting the mid-2023 release target. Key milestones include completing EIP-4848 implementation by Q2 2023 and conducting thorough testing across all clients before Phase 1.5 deployment."
