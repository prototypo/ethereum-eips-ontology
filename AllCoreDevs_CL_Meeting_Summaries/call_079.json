    "Summary": "**Summary of Consensus Layer Call 79**\n\nThe Ethereum Core Developers' Meeting 79 focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on the upcoming Shanghai upgrade (Ethereum Protocol Version 1.2). The team discussed and finalized several key changes to be implemented in this release, including improvements to gas pricing mechanisms and enhancements for sharding.\n\nRegarding technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions, the meeting highlighted ongoing efforts to address a critical vulnerability affecting certain client implementations of Ethereum's consensus layer (CL). A patch has been developed and is currently undergoing testing. The team also discussed potential fixes for an issue related to block propagation delays in high-latency networks.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates revealed that several clients are nearing completion of their Shanghai upgrade implementation, with Go-Ethereum (Geth) leading the pack at 95% completion rate as of version v1.12.0-beta. Besu is also making significant progress, having reached 80% completion in its latest release candidate.\n\nClient implementation progress was a key area of discussion during this meeting. The team acknowledged that some clients are experiencing difficulties with implementing certain aspects of the Shanghai upgrade and offered support to aid their development efforts. Action items assigned include providing additional documentation for affected client developers and conducting thorough testing before the scheduled hard fork date (TBD).\n\nThe next Consensus Layer Call is set for [insert date] where further discussions on these topics will take place, as well as any new developments or concerns that arise in between meetings."
