    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 011",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for the Beacon Chain. The proposal aims to reduce gas costs by allowing clients to verify only a subset of blocks instead of all transactions. After thorough discussion, it was decided that EIP-4848 will be implemented in Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several were reported during the meeting. Notably, **the `get_block_hash` function** has been identified as a potential source of errors due to its incorrect implementation. A proposed solution involves updating this function to correctly handle edge cases. Additionally, discussions centered around resolving an issue with the Beacon Chain's **block proposer selection mechanism**, which was causing inconsistent block production.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates were also discussed during the meeting. The team is on track to complete Phase 1 of Ethereum 2.0 by Q3 this year, as previously planned. Testing for Phase 1 has been ongoing with several clients participating in a **large-scale testnet**. Although some issues have arisen, progress remains steady.\n\nClient implementation progress was another key topic during the meeting. Several client teams reported on their current status and upcoming plans. Notably, Lighthouse is expected to release version **v5.0 soon**, which will include support for EIP-4848 among other features. The team also discussed potential collaboration opportunities between clients to ensure a unified implementation of new protocol changes.\n\nAction items assigned during the meeting included reviewing and finalizing the Beacon Chain's block proposer selection mechanism, as well as updating documentation on `get_block_hash` function usage. Upcoming deadlines include completing Phase 1 testing by Q3 this year and releasing Lighthouse v5.0 with EIP-4848 support."
