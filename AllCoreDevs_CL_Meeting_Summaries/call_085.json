    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nIn Meeting #123 of Ethereum Core Developers (Layer 1), we discussed several critical topics that will shape the future of our protocol. The primary focus was on **Protocol Decisions and EIP Discussions**, where we debated the merits of implementing EIP-4848, a proposed upgrade to improve scalability through data sharding. After thorough discussion, it was decided to move forward with implementation, targeting a deployment date in Q3 2022.\n\n**Technical Issues and Proposed Solutions**\n\nWe also addressed several technical issues that have been affecting client performance. Notably, the team has made significant progress on resolving the \"difficulty bomb\" issue (EIP-3554), which is expected to be fully resolved by the end of April. Additionally, we discussed a proposed solution for mitigating gas limit attacks through EIP-4488.\n\n**Development Milestones and Testing Updates**\n\nThe development community reported notable milestones in testing updates. The Go Ethereum client has successfully completed its integration with the sharding testnet, while Parity's implementation is nearing completion. We also received an update on the status of the \"Merge\" (Ethereum 2.0) transition plan, which aims to complete by mid-2023.\n\n**Action Items and Upcoming Deadlines**\n\nKey action items include:\n\n* Finalizing EIP-4848 implementation details\n* Resolving outstanding technical issues related to sharding\n* Completing testing updates for the Merge transition\n\nThe next meeting is scheduled for Thursday, 2022/4/14 at 14:00 UTC."
