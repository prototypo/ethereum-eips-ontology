    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 133",
    "Summary": "**Summary of Consensus Layer Call 133**\n\nThe primary focus area for this call was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4848, also known as \"Proto-Danksharding.\" The developers discussed the latest implementation details and addressed several concerns regarding its impact on network performance. A key takeaway is that the current implementation will require adjustments to client configurations for optimal functionality.\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were another crucial topic of discussion. Developers reported progress in resolving a critical bug affecting some clients' ability to process transactions efficiently. The team also explored potential fixes for an issue related to gas pricing calculations under certain conditions. While no definitive solution was agreed upon during the call, several possible approaches are being considered.\n\nRegarding **development milestones and testing updates**, it's worth noting that the next major milestone is approaching rapidly. As of this meeting, all core developers have committed to delivering their respective components on schedule for the upcoming release (version 1.2). Testing efforts continue with a focus on EIP-4848 integration and client compatibility.\n\n**Client implementation progress** was also discussed during the call. Several clients are now actively implementing Proto-Danksharding features, including Besu and Nethermind. However, some concerns were raised regarding potential issues related to network congestion under high loads of transactions per second (TPS). The team will continue monitoring these developments closely.\n\nLastly, **action items and upcoming deadlines** include a review of the current EIP-4848 implementation by all core developers within two weeks' time. This is expected to inform further refinements before its final integration into version 1.2."
