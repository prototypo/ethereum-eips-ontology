    "Summary": "**Consensus Layer Call 91 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers met for call number 91, focusing on several critical topics that will shape the future of the network. The discussion centered around **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a key highlight being the ongoing debate surrounding the implementation of EIP-4846 (Proto-Danksharding). This proposal aims to increase scalability by introducing a new type of transaction called \"proto-dank shards.\" After thorough review, it was decided that this EIP will be implemented in Ethereum 2.0's Bellatrix upgrade.\n\n**Technical issues and proposed solutions** were also discussed during the call. The team addressed several bugs reported since the previous meeting, including an issue with the Beacon Chain's proposer selection algorithm. A fix has been developed and is currently being tested by clients. Additionally, a new version of the Ethereum 2.0 client (version 1.10) was released to address these issues.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** were also covered during the call. The team reported progress on implementing EIP-4846 in Bellatrix, with an estimated completion timeline set for Q3 this year. Furthermore, a new testnet has been launched to facilitate further development and testing of upcoming upgrades.\n\nThe **client implementation progress** was discussed as well, with several clients reporting successful integration of the latest updates. Notably, Lighthouse client version 5.1.0 is now available, featuring improved performance and bug fixes.\n\nLastly, a list of **action items and upcoming deadlines** were outlined during the call. Key tasks include finalizing EIP-4846 implementation details by June 15th and conducting thorough testing before deployment in Bellatrix."
