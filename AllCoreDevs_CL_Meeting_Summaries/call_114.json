    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 114",
    "Summary": "**Summary of Consensus Layer Meeting 114**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team discussed the upcoming Shanghai upgrade (Ethereum Protocol Version 1.2). The key decision made was to finalize the implementation timeline, with a target deployment date set for September 2023. This will coincide with the merge of Ethereum's execution layer and consensus layer.\n\n**Technical issues and proposed solutions** were also extensively covered in this meeting. A critical bug affecting some client implementations (specifically Geth) related to gas limit handling was identified and discussed. The team agreed on a patch, which is expected to be implemented across all clients by the end of August 2023. Additionally, there was an update regarding ongoing efforts to resolve issues with the `geth` command-line interface.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted progress toward completing critical components for the Shanghai upgrade. The team reported that approximately 70% of necessary EIPs have been implemented or are in review status. Testing is also underway, focusing on integration between different client implementations (e.g., Geth, Besu) to ensure seamless interaction.\n\nThe **client implementation progress** update noted significant advancements across various clients, with most nearing completion for the Shanghai upgrade requirements. Notably, a new release of `besu` was announced, which includes several critical bug fixes and performance enhancements.\n\nLastly, key action items were assigned to team members regarding EIP review status updates and client testing coordination. The next meeting is scheduled in two weeks' time, with an emphasis on finalizing the Shanghai upgrade implementation timeline and addressing any remaining technical concerns."
