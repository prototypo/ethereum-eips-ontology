    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 010",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blob transactions\" that can reduce gas costs. The discussion centered around the potential benefits and drawbacks of this proposal, including its impact on scalability and security.\n\nRegarding technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions, several clients reported encountering difficulties with **Beacon Chain version 1.2** due to a bug in the `get_block_hash` function. A fix has been implemented, but it's essential for all clients to update their versions as soon as possible to avoid potential security risks.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, the team is on track to meet its **Q3 2024 deadline** for Beacon Chain version 2.0 release candidate (RC) preparation. Testing has been ongoing with a focus on improving performance and resolving outstanding issues.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed during the meeting. The most notable update came from Lighthouse, which reported significant improvements in terms of gas efficiency and overall network participation rates. Other clients like Prysm and Teku are working to address specific technical challenges related to their implementations.\n\nAction items assigned include a review of EIP-4848 by all core developers before its next iteration is proposed for implementation. Additionally, the team will continue testing Beacon Chain version 2.0 RCs with an emphasis on resolving any remaining issues prior to release candidate completion and subsequent deployment."
