    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 117",
    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nAt Consensus Layer Meeting 117, core developers discussed several critical topics that will shape the future of Ethereum's consensus layer. The primary focus was on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team reviewed proposals for improving network scalability and security.\n\nOne notable discussion centered around EIP-4846 (Proto-Danksharding), which aims to increase block capacity by 64 times through a new data structure called \"proto-dankard.\" After reviewing test results, developers agreed that this proposal is ready for implementation. Another key decision was the adoption of **Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4488**, which introduces a novel approach to handling network congestion.\n\n**Technical issues and proposed solutions** were also on the agenda. The team addressed several bugs in existing clients, including Geth and Nethermind, with patches expected for release soon. Additionally, developers discussed potential fixes for long-standing issues like \"gas limit\" problems that have plagued Ethereum's scalability efforts.\n\nRegarding **development milestones and testing updates**, core devs reported progress toward implementing EIP-4846 across various client implementations. Testing has shown promising results, but more work is needed to ensure seamless integration with existing protocols. The team also discussed upcoming deadlines for completing these tasks, including a target date of Q2 2023.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines**: Key takeaways from the meeting include:\n\n* Finalize EIP-4846 implementation across all clients by end-Q1 2024\n* Complete testing and validation of proto-dankard data structure within next two months\n* Address outstanding bugs in Geth, Nethermind, and other client implementations\n\nThese developments mark significant strides toward improving Ethereum's scalability and security."
