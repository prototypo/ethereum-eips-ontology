    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 088",
    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nIn Meeting #123 of Ethereum Core Developers (Layer 1), we discussed several critical topics that will shape the future of our protocol. The primary focus was on **Protocol Decisions and EIP Discussions**, where we debated the merits of implementing EIP-4848, a proposed upgrade to improve scalability through data sharding. After thorough discussion, it was decided to move forward with implementation, pending further testing.\n\n**Technical Issues and Proposed Solutions**\n\nWe also addressed several technical issues that have been plaguing our network. The team reported progress on resolving the \"difficulty bomb\" problem, which has been causing significant delays in block propagation times (version 1.10.4). Additionally, we discussed a proposed solution to mitigate gas price manipulation attacks using EIP-1559's dynamic fee mechanism.\n\n**Development Milestones and Testing Updates**\n\nOur development team made notable progress on implementing the \"Merge\" protocol upgrade, which aims to transition Ethereum from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). The current timeline suggests a mid-year completion date for this critical milestone. In terms of testing updates, we reviewed the latest results from our testnet and mainnet deployments.\n\n**Client Implementation Progress**\n\nThe client implementation progress was also discussed in detail during the meeting. Go-ethereum 1.10.x series has been updated to support EIP-4848, while Parity Ethereum is working on integrating this upgrade as well (version 2.7.x). The team emphasized the importance of continued collaboration and testing among clients.\n\n**Action Items and Upcoming Deadlines**\n\nTo ensure a smooth transition into our next phase, we assigned several action items to key stakeholders:\n\n* Finalize EIP-4848 implementation by June 15th\n* Complete Merge protocol upgrade development by July 31st\n* Conduct thorough testing of both upgrades before mainnet deployment\n\nThese developments will significantly impact the Ethereum ecosystem and require careful attention from all involved parties."
