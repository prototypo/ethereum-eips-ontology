    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 024",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for the Beacon Chain. The proposal aims to reduce gas costs by allowing clients to sample blocks instead of verifying all transactions. After thorough discussion, the team decided to proceed with implementing this feature in Ethereum 2.0.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, a critical **Beacon Node bug** was identified, which affects node synchronization during network upgrades. A proposed solution involves modifying the `get_block_hash` function to improve data consistency across nodes. The development milestone for resolving this issue is set at **Ethereum 1.2**, with an estimated completion date of Q3.\n\nClient implementation progress showed significant advancements from various teams, including Lighthouse and Prysm. Both clients have made substantial strides in implementing the proposed EIP-4848 changes. Notably, Lighthouse has achieved a notable milestone by successfully testing data availability sampling on their testnet environment.\n\nAction items for upcoming deadlines include finalizing the Beacon Chain's **Merge** timeline (estimated Q3) and completing the implementation of EIP-4848 across all clients. The team also discussed potential issues related to gas costs, which may require further adjustments in future protocol updates. Overall, this meeting highlighted significant progress toward implementing key features for Ethereum 2.0 while addressing critical technical concerns.\n\nThe next call is scheduled for [insert date] and will focus on reviewing the implementation of EIP-4848 across all clients as well as discussing any new proposals or issues that have arisen since the last meeting."
