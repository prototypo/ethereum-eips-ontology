    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 013",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blob transactions\" that can reduce the load on the network. The discussion centered around its implementation timeline, with a proposed activation date set for Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5 (version `bellatrix`). This update is expected to significantly improve scalability and efficiency.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several were discussed during the meeting. Notably, **the issue of \"gas limit\" inconsistencies** across different client implementations was brought up again. A proposed solution involves introducing a standardized gas limit calculation mechanism in the protocol layer. The developers also touched on ongoing efforts to resolve the `geth`-specific bug affecting some users.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, it's worth noting that **the Phase 1.5 testnet is expected to go live soon**, with an estimated timeline of two weeks from the meeting date (MEETING_DATE). This will allow developers to thoroughly test EIP-4848 before its activation in the main network.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed during the call, with a focus on **Lighthouse** and **Nethermind**. Both clients are making steady progress towards implementing Phase 1.5 features, including blob transactions. Action items assigned include finalizing the standardized gas limit calculation mechanism within two weeks from MEETING_DATE to ensure consistency across client implementations.\n\nOverall, this meeting highlighted significant developments in Ethereum's Consensus Layer and underscored ongoing efforts by core developers to improve scalability and efficiency through protocol updates like EIP-4848."
