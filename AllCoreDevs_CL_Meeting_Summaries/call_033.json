    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' consensus layer meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4846**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for the Beacon Chain. The proposal aims to reduce gas costs by allowing clients to verify only a subset of blocks instead of all transactions. After thorough discussion, it was decided that this EIP will be implemented in Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several were addressed during the meeting. Notably, **the `get_block_hash` function** bug has been resolved by updating the Beacon Chain to version v1.3.4. Additionally, a fix for the `attestations_v2` issue was proposed, which will be implemented in an upcoming release.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates were also discussed during the meeting. The team is on track with their **Phase 0 deployment timeline**, aiming to complete it by Q2 of this year. Testing has been ongoing, focusing primarily on data availability sampling for EIP-4846. Client implementation progress was reported as steady, with most clients supporting Phase 1 and some already implementing Phase 1.5 features.\n\nAction items assigned during the meeting include finalizing the **Ethereum 2.0 specification** document by the end of Q1 this year. Additionally, a review process for EIP-4846 has been initiated to ensure its readiness for implementation in Phase 1.5."
