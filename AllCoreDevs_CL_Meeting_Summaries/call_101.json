    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 101",
    "Summary": "**Summary of Consensus Layer Call 101**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, also known as \"Proto-Danksharding.\" This proposal aims to improve the scalability of the network by introducing a new type of transaction that can be processed more efficiently. The discussion centered around the implementation details, including the choice of data structure and the impact on existing clients.\n\nRegarding technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions, **the team addressed concerns related to the recent \"difficulty bomb\" issue**. This problem arises from the gradual increase in mining difficulty over time, which can lead to a significant decrease in block times as it approaches its maximum value. The developers discussed potential fixes, including adjusting the difficulty adjustment algorithm or introducing a new mechanism for handling this situation.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, **the team is on track to implement EIP-4848 by Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5**. This milestone will enable the network to process more transactions per second while reducing gas costs. The developers also reported progress in client implementation, with several clients now supporting key features of Proto-Danksharding.\n\nAction items and upcoming deadlines were discussed briefly during the call. **The team agreed on a deadline for implementing EIP-4848 by Q2 2023** to ensure that it is ready for deployment alongside Phase 1.5. This will enable users to take advantage of improved scalability features as soon as they are available.\n\nOverall, this meeting highlighted significant progress in the development and implementation of key Ethereum upgrades, with a focus on improving network efficiency and user experience through Proto-Danksharding."
