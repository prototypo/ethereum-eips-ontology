    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 120",
    "Summary": "**Summary of Consensus Layer Call 120**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on two critical topics: EIP discussions and technical issues. The team reviewed several proposals, with a significant emphasis placed on **EIP-4846**, which aims to improve the efficiency of data processing in the network by introducing a new type of transaction called \"blobs.\" This proposal has garnered substantial attention due to its potential impact on scalability.\n\nRegarding technical issues, developers discussed ongoing problems related to **gas pricing** and proposed solutions. A key concern is ensuring that gas prices remain stable during periods of high demand or unexpected changes in the network's congestion level. To address this issue, several clients are experimenting with different approaches, including dynamic gas price adjustments based on real-time data.\n\nIn terms of development milestones, the team reviewed progress toward implementing **Ethereum 2.0**, specifically focusing on client implementation and testing updates. The current version is **Prater (version 1.3)**, which has shown promising results in its ability to handle increased network loads without compromising security or performance. However, developers acknowledged that further refinement of the protocol's parameters will be necessary before a full-scale deployment.\n\nAction items assigned during this meeting include reviewing and refining EIP-4846 for potential inclusion in an upcoming hard fork. Additionally, clients are expected to provide regular updates on their implementation progress by **March 15th**. Overall, while several challenges remain, the team's collective efforts aim to ensure a seamless transition toward Ethereum 2.0.\n\nThe next meeting will focus on reviewing client implementations and discussing any outstanding technical issues related to EIP-4846."
