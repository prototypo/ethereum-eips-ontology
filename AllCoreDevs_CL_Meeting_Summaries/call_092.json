    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 092",
    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nIn Meeting #123 of Ethereum Layer 2 core developers, several crucial topics were discussed and addressed. The primary focus was on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team deliberated over proposed changes to improve scalability and security.\n\nOne key discussion centered around EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding), which aims to increase block capacity by up to 128 times through a novel data structure called \"proto-dank sharding.\" The proposal has been updated with new implementation details, including the use of Merkle trees for efficient data retrieval. After thorough review and debate, the team agreed on moving forward with EIP-4844 as part of Ethereum's upcoming Berlin hardfork (version 1.2).\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, several client-specific problems were reported by Parity and Geth developers. These included a bug in the execution engine that caused incorrect gas metering for certain opcodes. The team collaborated to identify root causes and implement fixes.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted significant progress on implementing EIP-1559 (London hardfork, version 1.2), which introduces a new fee market mechanism. Testing has been ongoing with multiple clients participating in the process. Notably, Parity reported successful integration of their implementation with the proposed changes to gas pricing.\n\nLastly, **Client implementation progress** showed that all major clients are on track for implementing EIP-4844 and other upcoming features. Action items were assigned to ensure timely completion of these tasks before the next meeting. The team also discussed an updated timeline for Berlin hardfork deployment (planned for Q3 2022)."
