    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 012",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of this proposal in terms of scalability improvements.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported across various clients, including Go-Ethereum (Geth) and Nethermind. A proposed solution for one such bug involved updating the `beacon_chain` module to address a synchronization issue that could lead to incorrect block processing. The developers also discussed potential solutions for mitigating the impact of these issues on network stability.\n\nIn terms of development milestones, the team is working towards implementing **Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1**, with an expected launch date in Q3 this year. Testing updates revealed some progress toward achieving a stable and secure consensus mechanism. The client implementation progress was also discussed, highlighting ongoing efforts to improve performance and scalability.\n\nAction items assigned during the meeting include reviewing EIP-4848 for potential inclusion in Ethereum's protocol roadmap and finalizing proposed solutions for reported bugs by **June 15th**. Additionally, developers were tasked with providing regular updates on their respective client implementations' progress toward achieving Phase 1 milestones."
