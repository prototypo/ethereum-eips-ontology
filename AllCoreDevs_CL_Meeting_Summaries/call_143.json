    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 143",
    "Summary": "**Consensus Layer Call 143 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers met for call number 143, focusing on several critical topics that will shape the future of the network. **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions** took center stage as the team reviewed proposals to improve the Beacon Chain's efficiency and scalability. Notably, they discussed EIP-4846 (Proto-Danksharding), which aims to increase block capacity by 64 times through a novel data structure called \"proto-dankshard.\" The proposal is expected to be implemented in Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1.5.\n\n**Technical issues and bugs were also addressed**, with the team reviewing several open tickets related to client compatibility, gas pricing, and network congestion mitigation strategies. A proposed solution for mitigating network congestion was discussed, which involves adjusting the block proposer's strategy based on current network conditions. This change is expected to be implemented in a future release of the Beacon Chain.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted progress toward implementing EIP-4846. The team reported that several clients have successfully tested proto-dankshard functionality, with some even achieving higher-than-expected block capacities. However, further testing and optimization are required before deployment.\n\nThe **client implementation progress** was also discussed, with the team reviewing status updates from various client developers. Notably, Lighthouse has made significant strides in implementing EIP-4846, while Nimbus is working on optimizing its proto-dankshard performance.\n\nIn terms of **action items and upcoming deadlines**, the team set a target for completing EIP-4846 implementation by Q2 2023. Additionally, they established a deadline for resolving outstanding technical issues related to client compatibility and network congestion mitigation strategies within the next two weeks."
