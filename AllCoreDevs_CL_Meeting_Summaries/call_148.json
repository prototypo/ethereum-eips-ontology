    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 148",
    "Summary": "**Consensus Layer Call 148 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers met for call number 148, focusing on several critical topics that will shape the future of the network. **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions** took center stage as the team debated the implementation details of EIP-4848 (Proto-Danksharding). After a thorough discussion, it was decided to proceed with implementing this proposal in Ethereum's upcoming Shanghai upgrade (version 1.2), which is scheduled for release on April 12th.\n\nRegarding **technical issues and bugs**, several concerns were raised regarding the performance of the current implementation of EIP-1559. The team discussed potential solutions, including adjustments to gas pricing mechanisms and further optimization of transaction processing times. It was agreed that a more in-depth analysis would be conducted before making any changes.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted significant progress on client implementations. Go-Ethereum (geth) has reached version 1.12.0-alpha.2, while Nethermind is working towards its v3 release candidate. The team also discussed the upcoming testnet for Shanghai, which will provide a critical environment to validate EIP-4848's performance.\n\n**Client implementation progress** showed that most clients are on track with their development schedules. However, some concerns were raised regarding the compatibility of certain features across different client implementations. To address these issues, an action item was assigned to create a comprehensive documentation outlining each client's feature set and roadmap.\n\nThe meeting concluded with several **action items and upcoming deadlines** being noted for further discussion on EIP-4848 implementation details and performance optimization efforts. The team will reconvene in two weeks' time to review progress made since the last call, ensuring that all stakeholders are aligned before the Shanghai upgrade's release date."
