    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 115",
    "Summary": "**Consensus Layer Call 115 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers met for call number 115, focusing on several critical topics that will shape the future of the network. The meeting began with a discussion around **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team reviewed proposals related to the upcoming Shanghai upgrade (Ethereum Protocol Version: 1.2). Notably, they discussed EIP-4844, which aims to improve data availability on the Ethereum mainnet by introducing a new type of transaction called \"Proto-Danksharding.\" The proposal is expected to increase scalability and reduce gas costs.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, the team addressed several concerns related to client compatibility with upcoming protocol changes. Specifically, they discussed potential issues with the `geth` client's ability to handle new features in the Shanghai upgrade. To mitigate these risks, developers agreed on a plan for thorough testing and bug fixing before the release.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** were also covered during the meeting. The team reported progress toward implementing EIP-4844 in various clients, including `geth` (version 1.12) and `nethermind`. Testing has been ongoing to ensure seamless integration with other components of the Ethereum ecosystem. Additionally, developers discussed plans for a comprehensive testing framework to validate client behavior under different scenarios.\n\n**Client implementation progress**, as mentioned earlier, is advancing steadily. The team reported that several clients are now compatible with EIP-4844 and have begun implementing it in their codebases. This development milestone marks significant progress toward the Shanghai upgrade's goals of improving scalability and reducing gas costs on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThe meeting concluded with **action items and upcoming deadlines**, including a plan for thorough testing before the release, which is expected to occur within the next few weeks (targeting mid-April)."
