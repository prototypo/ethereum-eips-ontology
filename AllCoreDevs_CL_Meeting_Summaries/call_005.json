    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 005",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' fifth meeting focused primarily on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) 4844, which proposes the introduction of \"Proto-Danksharding\" to improve scalability. The discussion centered around addressing concerns regarding gas costs and potential security implications.\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were also extensively discussed during this meeting. Notably, a bug in the current implementation of the Beacon Chain's fork choice rule was identified by developers from Lighthouse (version 5.0) and Prysm (version 2.1). The issue arises when handling multiple validators with conflicting votes on different blocks.\n\nRegarding **development milestones and testing updates**, it is worth noting that the team has made significant progress in implementing EIP-4844, with several clients now supporting this feature. However, there are still concerns regarding its integration into existing protocols due to potential gas cost implications.\n\n**Client implementation progress** was also a key topic of discussion during the meeting. Lighthouse (version 5.0) and Prysm (version 2.1) have both made notable strides in implementing EIP-4844, with other clients expected to follow suit soon. The team is working towards achieving full compatibility across all major client implementations.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** were also discussed during the meeting. Key action items include finalizing a plan for integrating Proto-Danksharding into existing protocols by Q2 2023 and addressing outstanding technical issues related to EIP-4844 implementation in various clients."
