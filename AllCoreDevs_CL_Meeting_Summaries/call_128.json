    "Summary": "**Summary of Consensus Layer Meeting 128**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team discussed a proposed update to the Ethereum protocol, specifically regarding the implementation of the \"Ethereum Improvement Proposal\" (EIP) 4846. This proposal aims to increase block gas limits by introducing a new type of transaction called \"sharding-capable transactions.\" The discussion centered around potential issues with backward compatibility and the need for further testing.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, several clients reported encountering difficulties with recent protocol upgrades. For instance, Geth 1.12 experienced an issue where it would incorrectly validate certain types of blocks. Meanwhile, Besu developers are working on a fix to address a problem related to the handling of \"uncle\" headers.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** revealed that several clients have made significant progress in implementing EIP-4846. For example, Prysmatic Labs' client has successfully tested sharding-capable transactions with an increased block gas limit. However, more work is needed before this feature can be fully integrated into the mainnet.\n\nIn terms of **Client implementation progress**, most major clients have made notable strides in implementing EIP-4846 and other recent protocol upgrades. For instance, Nethermind has successfully tested sharding-capable transactions with a block gas limit increase to 150 million units (MU). The team also discussed ongoing testing efforts for the upcoming \"Shapella\" upgrade.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** include finalizing EIP-4846 implementation across all clients by March 1st, followed by thorough testing before deployment. Additionally, developers are working on resolving outstanding technical issues to ensure a smooth transition with Shapella."
