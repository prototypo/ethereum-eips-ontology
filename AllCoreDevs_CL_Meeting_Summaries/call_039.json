    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 039",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4848, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for the Beacon Chain. The discussion centered around its implementation details, including gas costs and potential impact on network performance.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, several clients reported encountering difficulties in syncing due to an issue related to the `get_block_hash` function. A patch has been submitted by the developers of Lighthouse client, which is expected to resolve this problem soon. Additionally, a bug was identified in the implementation of EIP-4848's data availability sampling mechanism.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted several notable achievements. The Beacon Chain's Bellatrix upgrade (version 1.2) has been successfully deployed on testnets, marking an important step towards Ethereum 2.0 mainnet launch preparations. Furthermore, the developers reported progress in implementing EIP-4848 across various clients.\n\nThe **Client implementation progress** section revealed that several clients are actively working to integrate EIP-4848 into their codebases. Lighthouse and Prysm have made significant strides, while Teku is close behind with its own implementation plan. The meeting concluded with a focus on ensuring seamless integration of the proposed changes across all client implementations.\n\nThe **Action items and upcoming deadlines** included finalizing the Bellatrix upgrade for mainnet deployment by Q2 2023 and completing EIP-4848's testing phase within the next two weeks."
