    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 076",
    "Summary": "**Summary of Consensus Layer Call 76**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4846**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently than traditional transactions. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of this proposal, including improved scalability and reduced gas costs.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported in various clients, with notable mentions being **Geth 1.10.8** and **Nethermind 0.7.2-rc.3**, which are experiencing memory leaks under certain conditions. Proposed solutions involve updating the affected code to prevent these issues from occurring.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates highlighted several key areas of focus, including the ongoing work on **EIP-4846's implementation** in various clients. The team is working towards a target release date for EIP-4846, with an estimated timeline of 2-3 weeks before it can be deployed to mainnet.\n\nClient implementation progress showed that most major clients are making good headway with implementing the necessary changes for EIP-4846. Notably, **Nethermind** has already implemented a working prototype and is actively testing its performance.\n\nAction items assigned during this meeting include reviewing and finalizing the proposed solutions for the reported bugs in Geth 1.10.8 and Nethermind 0.7.2-rc.3 by the end of next week, with an expected resolution date set for two weeks from now."
