    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 139",
    "Summary": "**Consensus Layer Call 139 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers met for call number 139, focusing on several critical topics that impact the network's development and stability.\n\n**Protocol Decisions and EIP Discussions**\nOne of the primary discussions centered around EIP-4846 (Proto-Danksharding), which aims to improve scalability by reducing gas costs. The team agreed upon a revised implementation plan, with version 1.0 expected in Q2 2023. Another notable discussion revolved around EIP-4488 (Verkle Trees), designed for efficient set membership proofs. While no consensus was reached on the proposal's inclusion in the next protocol upgrade, it remains under consideration.\n\n**Technical Issues and Proposed Solutions**\nThe team addressed a critical bug affecting some clients' ability to process transactions with high gas limits. A proposed patch has been submitted for review, aiming for implementation within the next two weeks. Additionally, discussions around improving network congestion handling through more efficient block propagation mechanisms are ongoing.\n\n**Development Milestones and Testing Updates**\nSeveral development milestones were highlighted during the call. The Goerli testnet is expected to receive a major upgrade in Q2 2023, incorporating recent protocol changes. Meanwhile, Ropsten's status remains uncertain due to infrastructure issues affecting its maintenance schedule.\n\n**Client Implementation Progress**\nMost clients are on track with implementing EIP-4846 and other upcoming features. However, some concerns were raised regarding the compatibility of certain client versions with future upgrades. The team emphasized the importance of maintaining backward-compatibility across different implementations.\n\nAction items from this meeting include reviewing the proposed patch for the gas limit bug and finalizing a timeline for Ropsten's upgrade or potential replacement."
