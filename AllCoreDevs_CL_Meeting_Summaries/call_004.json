    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 004",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum 2.0 Implementers Call 4 focused on several critical aspects of the project's development. **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions** were a primary concern, with the team deliberating over the implementation of the \"Difficulty Bomb Delay\" (EIP-4345). This proposal aims to delay the difficulty bomb by approximately two years, providing more time for clients to upgrade before it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain the network. The discussion centered around potential drawbacks and benefits, ultimately leading to a decision in favor of implementing EIP-4345.\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were also extensively discussed during the meeting. Notably, the team addressed concerns regarding the \"Bellatrix\" upgrade's impact on client synchronization times. It was agreed that further testing is required to optimize this process before its scheduled deployment in August 2022 (Ethereum Mainnet Merge). Additionally, a bug affecting the Beacon Chain's block proposer selection mechanism was identified and assigned for resolution.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted significant progress toward the Ethereum 2.0 launch. The team reported that all major clients are now compatible with the \"Bellatrix\" upgrade, marking an essential step towards the Merge event. Furthermore, a comprehensive test plan has been developed to ensure seamless integration of the Beacon Chain with the existing Mainnet.\n\nThe meeting concluded with **client implementation progress** updates from various teams. Notably, Lighthouse and Prysm clients reported significant advancements in their development pipelines. Lastly, action items were assigned for upcoming deadlines, including finalizing EIP-4345's implementation details by July 2022 (Ethereum Merge)."
