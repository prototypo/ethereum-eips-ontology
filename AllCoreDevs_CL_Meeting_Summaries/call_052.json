    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' consensus layer meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4846**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for the Beacon Chain. The discussion centered around its implementation timeline, with a proposed activation date of Shanghai (version 1.2) in June 2023.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several were addressed during the meeting. Notably, an issue affecting the LMD-GHOST fork choice rule was identified and is being worked on by developers. Additionally, discussions around **EIP-4488**, which proposes to increase gas limits for execution layers, highlighted potential implications for client implementation.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates included a review of the Beacon Chain's current status. The chain has been running smoothly since its launch in December 2020 (version 1.0), with over 10 million validators participating as of March 2023. Testing efforts are ongoing to ensure readiness for future upgrades, including Shanghai.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed during the meeting. Several clients have implemented EIP-4846 and other proposed changes, but some still require further work before activation. Notably, **Lighthouse** has made significant strides in implementing data availability sampling.\n\nAction items and upcoming deadlines were outlined at the end of the discussion. Key tasks include finalizing EIP implementations, resolving outstanding technical issues, and conducting thorough testing to ensure a smooth upgrade process for Shanghai. The next meeting will focus on reviewing progress toward these goals and addressing any emerging concerns or challenges."
