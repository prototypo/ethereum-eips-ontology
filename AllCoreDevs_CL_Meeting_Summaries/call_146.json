    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 146",
    "Summary": "**Summary of Consensus Layer Call 146**\n\nThe primary focus area for this call was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team discussed the upcoming Berlin hardfork, scheduled to occur on April 15th (Ethereum Improvement Proposal #256). The main topic centered around the `CREATE2` opcode implementation. After a thorough review of potential security risks and performance implications, it was decided that the proposal would proceed as planned.\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were also addressed during this call. A critical bug in the `geth` client's gas metering system was identified and assigned to be fixed by the next major release (v1.10). Additionally, a discussion on improving the performance of the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain took place.\n\nRegarding **development milestones and testing updates**, it was reported that the development team is making steady progress toward implementing the `deposit contract` for Phase 0 of The Merge. Testing has been ongoing with encouraging results; however, some minor issues remain to be resolved before moving forward.\n\n**Client implementation progress** showed significant advancements in various client implementations (e.g., Prysm and Lighthouse). These developments are crucial steps towards achieving a unified Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain.\n\nLastly, **action items and upcoming deadlines** were outlined for the next call: resolving outstanding issues with `geth` gas metering, finalizing Phase 0 testing, and continuing client implementation progress toward The Merge's target timeline (Q3/Q4)."
