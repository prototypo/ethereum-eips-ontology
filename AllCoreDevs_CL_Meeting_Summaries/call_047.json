    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 047",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4846**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for the execution layer. The discussion centered around its potential impact on scalability and gas costs. After thorough deliberation, it was decided that this proposal will be implemented in Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5.\n\nRegarding technical issues, a critical bug affecting the **Beacon Chain**'s performance was identified and addressed by implementing an optimization to reduce memory usage. This fix is expected to improve overall network efficiency and mitigate potential congestion points. Furthermore, discussions around proposed solutions for mitigating the impact of **MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)** on Ethereum's security were also held.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates highlighted significant progress toward completing Phase 1.5 implementation. The team has made substantial strides in integrating EIP-4846 with other ongoing developments, such as the introduction of data availability sampling for execution layers. Testing is currently underway to ensure seamless integration across various client implementations.\n\nClient implementation progress showed notable advancements from key contributors like **Lighthouse**, **Nethermind**, and **Teku**. These clients are actively working on incorporating EIP-4846 into their codebases, with Lighthouse already reporting successful testing results. The team is optimistic about meeting the upcoming deadline for Phase 1.5 completion.\n\nAction items assigned during this meeting include finalizing the implementation of data availability sampling in execution layers and conducting thorough security audits to ensure the integrity of Ethereum's consensus layer."
