    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 007",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4848, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of this proposal, including improved scalability and reduced gas costs.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, several clients reported encountering difficulties with the recent protocol upgrades (Berlin Hardfork). Specifically, Geth experienced a bug related to the `GETH` command-line interface, while Besu encountered an issue with its transaction processing. The developers acknowledged these problems and are working on resolving them.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted progress toward implementing Ethereum 2.0's Beacon Chain. Notably, Prysmatic Labs reported that their client is now capable of producing blocks at a rate consistent with the target block time (12 seconds). Additionally, Lighthouse developers announced they have successfully completed several rounds of stress tests.\n\nIn terms of **Client implementation progress**, most clients are actively working on implementing EIP-4848. However, there were concerns raised about potential compatibility issues between different client implementations and the proposed protocol changes. The meeting concluded with a reminder that all stakeholders should prioritize testing their clients against each other to ensure seamless integration once the new features go live.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** included finalizing the EIP-4848 specification by **April 15th**, followed by an additional two-week review period before its implementation can proceed."
