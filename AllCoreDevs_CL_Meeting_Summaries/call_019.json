    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 019",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' consensus layer meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4846**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for the Beacon Chain. The proposal aims to reduce gas costs by allowing clients to sample blocks instead of verifying all transactions. After thorough discussion, it was decided that this EIP will be implemented in Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, a critical **issue with the Bellatrix upgrade** (version v1.3) was addressed. The team identified a problem where validators could become stuck due to an incorrect assumption about block timestamps. A proposed fix involves adjusting the timestamp logic in the Beacon Chain codebase. This update is expected to be included in the upcoming release of Ethereum 2.0's client software.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, **the Bellatrix upgrade** (version v1.3) has been successfully tested on testnets with no major issues reported. The team also discussed plans for a future merge between the Beacon Chain and the execution layer, which is expected to occur in Phase 2 of Ethereum 2.0.\n\nClient implementation progress was noted as steady, with **Lighthouse** (version v5.1) being one of the most actively developed clients. Other notable implementations include Prysm (v3.4), Teku (v6.8), and Nimbus (v7.9). The team emphasized the importance of continued collaboration among client developers to ensure a smooth transition between phases.\n\nAction items for upcoming deadlines were discussed, including finalizing EIP-4846 implementation details by **March 15th** and completing Bellatrix upgrade testing on mainnet by **April 1st**."
