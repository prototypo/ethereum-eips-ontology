    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce \"blob storage\" for improved scalability. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of this feature, including reduced gas costs and increased transaction capacity. After thorough deliberation, the consensus was reached that EIP-4848 will be implemented in Ethereum 2.0's upcoming **Bellatrix** upgrade (version `altair-v1+bellatrix`).\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, a notable discussion revolved around resolving an issue with the **Beacon Chain's** block proposer selection mechanism. The developers proposed implementing a new algorithm to mitigate potential centralization risks associated with this process.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, it was reported that the Beacon Chain is currently operating on version `altair-v1`, which has been live since September 2022 (approximately **6 months**). Testing for Bellatrix upgrade preparations continues, aiming to ensure a smooth transition. The developers also discussed ongoing efforts to improve client implementation progress.\n\nAction items and upcoming deadlines were highlighted as critical components of the meeting's discussion. Key milestones include completing EIP-4848 testing by Q1 2024 (approximately **3 months** from now) and finalizing Bellatrix upgrade preparations for a mid-year release target."
