    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 006",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' sixth meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4846**, which proposes to introduce \"blob storage\" in the Beacon Chain. This feature aims to improve scalability by allowing for more efficient data processing. The discussion centered around its implementation details, including gas costs and potential security implications.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported across various clients, with notable mentions being **geth** (version 1.10.14) and **lighthouse** (version v5.2.0). Proposed solutions included updates to the consensus layer protocol and adjustments to client configurations. The meeting also touched on development milestones, highlighting progress toward implementing EIP-4846 in upcoming releases.\n\nClient implementation progress was another key area of discussion. Developers reported advancements in integrating blob storage with various clients, including **prysm** (version v1.2.0) and **teku** (version 3.5). Testing updates revealed some challenges related to the new feature's integration but overall showed promising results.\n\nAction items assigned during the meeting included reviewing EIP-4846 implementation details by a specific deadline, conducting thorough testing of blob storage functionality across multiple clients, and providing feedback on proposed solutions for reported bugs. The next meeting will focus on addressing these action items and discussing further developments in protocol decisions and client implementations."
