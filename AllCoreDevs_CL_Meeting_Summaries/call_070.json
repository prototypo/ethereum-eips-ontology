    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 070",
    "Summary": "**Summary of Meeting MEETING_NUM**\n\nThe Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers met to discuss several critical topics related to Ethereum 2.0's development progress. The primary focus was on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team reviewed and finalized proposals for upcoming protocol upgrades, including EIP-4846 (Base Fee) and EIP-3074 (Type 1 transactions). These enhancements aim to improve scalability and reduce gas costs.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, several critical concerns were addressed. The developers discussed a potential issue with the Beacon Chain's block proposer selection mechanism, which could lead to reduced network security if left unaddressed. A fix is being implemented in version 1.2 of the consensus layer client (CL) codebase.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted significant progress on the CL implementation. The team has successfully completed integration tests for the proposed EIPs, with a focus on ensuring seamless interactions between different components of the Ethereum network. Additionally, the developers reported that they are nearing completion of the finalization phase for the Beacon Chain's sharding upgrade.\n\nThe **Client implementation progress** update revealed that several clients (e.g., Lighthouse and Nimbus) have reached version 1.2 or higher, incorporating recent bug fixes and performance enhancements. This milestone marks a significant step toward achieving full compatibility across various client implementations.\n\nLastly, the team assigned several action items with upcoming deadlines to ensure timely completion of these critical tasks. These include finalizing EIP-4846 implementation details by MEETING_NUM+1 and conducting thorough testing for sharding upgrades within the next two weeks."
