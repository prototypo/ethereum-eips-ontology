    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 111",
    "Summary": "**Summary of Consensus Layer Meeting 111**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4848, also known as \"Blob Storage\". The developers discussed the latest updates to the proposal, including changes to the blob storage format and its implications on network performance. A key decision made during the discussion was to move forward with implementing EIP-4848 in the upcoming Berlin hardfork (version 1.2), which is scheduled for release by mid-July.\n\n**Technical issues and proposed solutions** were also a major topic of conversation, particularly regarding the \"difficulty bomb\" issue that has been affecting network performance. The developers discussed potential fixes, including adjusting the difficulty adjustment algorithm to reduce its impact on the network. Additionally, they touched upon ongoing efforts to resolve an issue with gas pricing in relation to EIP-1559.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** were also covered during the meeting. It was reported that client implementation progress is steady, with most clients showing good compatibility with the upcoming Berlin hardfork. Testing for this release has been ongoing, with a focus on ensuring smooth integration of new features like blob storage.\n\nIn terms of **action items and upcoming deadlines**, several key milestones were highlighted. The next meeting will take place in two weeks' time to review progress made since the last gathering. Additionally, developers are expected to submit their final implementations for EIP-4848 by June 22nd."
