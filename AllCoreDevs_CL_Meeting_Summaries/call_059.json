    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 059",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum 2.0 Implementers Call 59 focused on several critical aspects of the project's development. **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions** were a major topic, with the team discussing the implementation details for EIP-4844 (Base Fee Upgrade). The proposal aims to improve scalability by introducing a new type of transaction that can be processed more efficiently. After thorough discussion, the team agreed on moving forward with implementing this upgrade in Ethereum 2.0's Bellatrix phase.\n\n**Technical issues and proposed solutions** were also extensively discussed during the meeting. A critical bug was identified in the Lighthouse client regarding its handling of beacon chain blocks. The developers worked together to propose a fix for this issue, which is expected to be implemented soon. Additionally, there were discussions around improving the performance of the Prysm client's consensus engine.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted several key achievements since the previous meeting. The team has made significant progress in implementing the Bellatrix phase, with all clients now supporting it. Testing for this phase is ongoing, with a focus on ensuring seamless integration between different components. Furthermore, the developers have started working on the Capella phase, which will introduce further improvements to Ethereum 2.0's scalability and security.\n\n**Client implementation progress** showed that most clients are making good headway in implementing Bellatrix features. However, there were some concerns raised regarding Lighthouse's performance issues during testing. The team is actively addressing these problems through collaborative efforts.\n\nThe meeting concluded with several **action items and upcoming deadlines**, including the completion of EIP-4844 implementation by all clients within a set timeframe (approximately 2 weeks). Regular updates on client progress, bug fixes, and protocol discussions will continue to be shared in future meetings."
