    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 106",
    "Summary": "**Summary of Consensus Layer Call 106**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently than traditional transactions. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of this proposal, including improved scalability and reduced gas costs.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported in various clients, with notable mentions being **Geth 1.10.8** and **Nethermind 0.7.2-rc.3**, which are currently experiencing memory leaks under specific conditions. Proposed solutions include updating the affected code to address these issues.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates highlighted several key areas of focus for upcoming releases, including further optimization work on EIP-4848 and continued development of **Ethereum 2.0's** beacon chain implementation (version **Concordance v1.3.4**). Testing efforts are ongoing to ensure the stability and security of these new features.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed, with notable updates from various teams working on integrating EIP-4848 into their respective clients. The Nethermind team reported significant performance improvements following recent optimizations.\n\nAction items assigned during this call include:\n\n* Finalizing a formal proposal for EIP-4848 by the end of **Q2 2023**\n* Resolving outstanding bugs in Geth and other affected clients\n* Conducting thorough testing to ensure stability before releasing new features\n\nThese developments are crucial steps towards improving Ethereum's scalability, security, and overall performance."
