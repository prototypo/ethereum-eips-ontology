    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 056",
    "Summary": "The CL and EL team meetings are summarized in files using the Markdown format. \n\n[[\n## Summary\n]]\n\n\nStatus of Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1 is that it has been deployed on devnet for testing purposes. The mainnet deployment timeline remains uncertain due to ongoing issues with the Beacon Chain's finalization mechanism.\n\n\nThe CL and EL teams are working together to resolve these issues, including implementing a new finality gadget called \"LMD-GRANDPA\" which will be tested in the coming weeks. This is expected to improve the overall performance of Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1 on mainnet once deployed.\n\n\nA key task for this week was reviewing and testing LMD-GRANDPA, with several team members contributing code changes and test cases. The teams are also working together to resolve issues related to the Beacon Chain's finalization mechanism.\n\n\nThe next steps include further testing of LMD-GRANDPA on devnet before mainnet deployment can proceed."
