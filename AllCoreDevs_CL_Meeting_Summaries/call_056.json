    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 056",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blob-carrying transactions.\" This proposal aims to improve the efficiency of data processing within the network. The discussion centered around its potential impact on scalability and gas costs.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported in various client implementations. Notably, **Beacon Chain v0.9** was identified as having a critical issue related to validator set updates. A proposed solution involves modifying the `get_beacon_state` function to correctly handle these updates. The developers acknowledged that this fix will be included in an upcoming release.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, **Beacon Chain v0.10** is expected to introduce several improvements, including enhanced error handling for validator set changes. Testing has been ongoing with a focus on stress-testing the network under various scenarios. Notably, the team reported that they have successfully completed tests simulating 100k validators.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed during the meeting. **Lighthouse v5** and **Nethermind v0.9** were highlighted as notable releases in recent weeks. These updates bring improvements to performance, security, and usability for end-users.\n\nAction items assigned include reviewing EIP-4848's impact on gas costs and finalizing a timeline for implementing the proposed solution. The next meeting is scheduled to discuss further progress on these topics and address any emerging concerns."
