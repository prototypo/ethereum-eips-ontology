    "Summary": "**Summary of Consensus Layer Meeting 108**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team extensively reviewed and discussed several proposals, particularly around the upcoming Shanghai upgrade (Ethereum Protocol Version 1.2). The key consensus reached was to finalize the implementation details for the proposed changes in the next few weeks.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, a critical discussion centered on resolving an ongoing issue with **gas limit optimization** in the Beacon Chain's execution layer. A potential solution involving adjustments to gas limits and fees has been proposed by developers, which is currently being reviewed and tested. The team also acknowledged several minor bug fixes across various clients.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, it was reported that the Shanghai upgrade testnets are progressing as planned, with a focus on **finalizing EIP-3651** (the \"Shanghai\" hard fork) implementation by mid-March. This will enable further testing before the scheduled mainnet deployment in April.\n\nClient implementation progress showed significant advancements across various clients, including Lighthouse and Prysm. These implementations are now aligned closely with each other, ensuring a smoother transition to the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nAction items assigned during this meeting include finalizing gas limit optimization adjustments by March 15th and completing EIP-3651 testing on testnets before mainnet deployment in April. The team will reconvene for another update soon after these milestones are achieved."
