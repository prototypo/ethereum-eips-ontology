    "Summary": "**Summary of Consensus Layer Meeting 134**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **EIP discussions and protocol decisions**, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4846, also known as \"Proto-Danksharding.\" The developers discussed the latest implementation details and addressed concerns regarding its impact on network performance. A key decision made during the meeting is to proceed with implementing EIP-4846 in Ethereum's mainnet by **Q3 2024**, pending further testing.\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were also a major topic of discussion. The team identified several critical bugs affecting client stability and network security. A notable issue was resolved regarding the \"difficulty bomb\" mechanism, which is expected to be fixed in upcoming releases (version **1.2.0-alpha**) by mid-June 2024.\n\nRegarding development milestones and testing updates, the meeting highlighted progress on implementing EIP-4846's prerequisites, including the \"Proto-Danksharding\" testnet deployment. The team aims to complete this milestone within the next two weeks. Additionally, a new **testing framework** is being developed to facilitate more efficient bug detection and resolution.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed during the meeting. Several clients are actively working on implementing EIP-4846, with notable updates from Prysm (version 1.2.0-alpha) and Lighthouse (version v5.3.0). The team emphasized the importance of maintaining compatibility across different client implementations to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nAction items assigned during this meeting include:\n\n* Finalizing EIP-4846 implementation details by June 15, 2024\n* Resolving outstanding bugs affecting network security and stability within two weeks\n* Completing Proto-Danksharding testnet deployment by the end of May"
