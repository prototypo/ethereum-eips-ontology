    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 082",
    "Summary": "**Summary of Consensus Layer Call 82**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce \"blobs\" as a new type of transaction data in the Ethereum network. The discussion centered around its potential benefits for scalability and gas efficiency improvements.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported across various clients, including an issue affecting the `geth` client's ability to handle large numbers of pending transactions efficiently. Proposed solutions included implementing a more efficient handling mechanism or adjusting the current implementation to better manage memory usage.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, **Beacon Chain v1.2** is nearing completion with its scheduled release date set for Q3 2024. This update includes improvements in gas efficiency and scalability enhancements through EIP-4848 integration. Testing has been ongoing across various clients to ensure seamless compatibility upon the Beacon Chain's upgrade.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed, particularly regarding **Lighthouse**'s efforts to integrate with EIP-4848. The team reported making significant strides but acknowledged that further testing and refinement were necessary before its full deployment.\n\nAction items assigned during this meeting include finalizing the details of EIP-4848's integration into Beacon Chain v1.2, addressing outstanding bugs across clients, and continuing thorough testing to ensure a smooth transition with upcoming updates."
