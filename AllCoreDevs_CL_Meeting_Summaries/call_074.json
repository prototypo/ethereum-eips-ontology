    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 074",
    "Summary": "**Summary of PoS Implementers' Call 74**\n\nThe Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers discussed several crucial topics during their meeting on October 21, 2021 (Call 74). The primary focus was on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team reviewed proposals for upcoming protocol upgrades. Notably, they finalized a decision to implement the \"Difficulty Bomb Delay\" in Ethereum's Proof of Stake (PoS) transition plan, which will be included in the Berlin hardfork scheduled for December 2021.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, the developers addressed several critical concerns related to client stability and performance. Specifically, they discussed a bug fix for the \" Beacon Chain\" that affects clients' ability to process blocks efficiently. The team also reviewed proposals for improving network congestion handling in PoS environments.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** were another key area of discussion. The developers reported progress on implementing the \"Merge\" protocol upgrade, which will integrate Ethereum's Proof-of-Work (PoW) chain with its Beacon Chain. They noted that several client implementations are nearing completion, including Prysm and Lighthouse. Testing for these upgrades is ongoing, with a focus on ensuring seamless integration between PoS clients.\n\n**Client implementation progress** was also discussed in detail during the meeting. The developers reported significant advancements from various teams working on implementing Ethereum's Consensus Layer protocols. Notably, they mentioned that several client implementations are now compatible with each other and can interoperate seamlessly.\n\nThe team assigned **action items and upcoming deadlines**, including a review of EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding) by November 1st to ensure its readiness for the Merge upgrade in Q2 2023."
