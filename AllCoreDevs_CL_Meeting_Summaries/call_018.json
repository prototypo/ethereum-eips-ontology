    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 018",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' consensus layer meeting focused primarily on **Protocol Decisions and EIP Discussions**, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4848, also known as the \"Proto-Danksharding\" proposal. The team discussed potential changes to the protocol's data structure, aiming to improve scalability without compromising security. A key takeaway was that the current implementation of EIP-4848 is expected to be finalized by **Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1** (Goerli testnet) and will undergo further testing before its integration into the main network.\n\nRegarding **Technical Issues, Bugs, and Proposed Solutions**, several bugs were reported in various client implementations. Notably, a critical issue affecting the Lighthouse client was identified and addressed promptly by the developers. Additionally, discussions centered around proposed solutions for mitigating potential issues related to data availability sampling (DAS) in the consensus layer.\n\n**Development Milestones and Testing Updates** highlighted progress toward completing Phase 1 of Ethereum 2.0's development roadmap. The team is on track to meet its scheduled milestones, with a focus on finalizing EIP-4848 implementation before transitioning to Phase 2 testing. Notably, Goerli testnet has been upgraded to **Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1**, allowing for more comprehensive testing of the new protocol.\n\n**Client Implementation Progress** showed that various clients are making steady progress toward implementing Ethereum 2.0 features. Lighthouse and Nimbus have reported significant advancements in their EIP-4848 implementations, while Prysm has made notable strides in optimizing its performance on testnets.\n\nLastly, **Action Items and Upcoming Deadlines**, the team emphasized the importance of completing Phase 1 testing by Q3 this year to ensure a smooth transition into Phase 2. Key action items include finalizing EIP-4848 implementation, addressing outstanding technical issues, and preparing for upcoming deadlines related to Ethereum 2.0's development roadmap."
