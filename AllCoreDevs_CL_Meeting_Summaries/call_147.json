    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 147",
    "Summary": "**Consensus Layer Call 147 Summary**\n\nThe primary focus of this call was Protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently than traditional transactions. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of increased scalability and reduced gas costs for users.\n\nRegarding technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions, several clients reported ongoing struggles with **Beacon Chain synchronization** due to inconsistent block propagation times between validators. To address this issue, a proposal was put forth to implement an \"early warning system\" that would alert validators when their node is falling behind in sync. This solution aims to prevent chain splits and ensure the integrity of the network.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, **Goerli testnet** has been upgraded to run on Ethereum 2.0 protocol version 1.3.4, which includes several bug fixes and performance improvements. The team also reported progress in implementing EIP-4848 on Goerli, with a target deployment date set for the next week.\n\nClient implementation progress was discussed briefly, with **Lighthouse** reporting significant advancements in their integration of EIP-4848. However, other clients such as **Nethermind** and **Teku** are still working to implement this feature.\n\nAction items assigned during the call include:\n\n* Finalizing the early warning system proposal for Beacon Chain synchronization\n* Deploying EIP-4848 on Goerli testnet within a week\n* Continuing client implementation progress, particularly with Lighthouse's integration of EIP-4848\n\nThese developments are crucial to ensuring the continued growth and stability of Ethereum 2.0."
