    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 045",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for the Beacon Chain. The proposal aims to reduce gas costs by allowing clients to verify only a subset of blocks instead of all transactions. After thorough discussion, it was decided that the implementation will proceed as planned.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several were reported across various client implementations. Notably, **Lighthouse** developers encountered an issue with incorrect block number calculation in certain scenarios, which has since been resolved through code updates (version 5.1). Additionally, discussions centered around a potential fix for the \"missing attestations\" problem affecting some clients.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates highlighted progress toward implementing EIP-4848. The **Goerli testnet** is expected to be upgraded with the new protocol in mid-March, allowing developers to test their implementations before mainnet deployment (targeted for Q2 2023). Client implementation progress was also discussed; notable advancements include **Nethermind's** recent upgrade to version 1.9.\n\nAction items and upcoming deadlines were reviewed during the meeting. Key takeaways included:\n\n* Finalizing EIP-4848 documentation by March 15th\n* Completing Goerli testnet upgrades before mid-March\n* Reviewing client implementation progress for potential merge readiness\n\nOverall, this call demonstrated significant momentum toward implementing key Ethereum Consensus Layer updates and ensuring a smooth transition to the new protocol."
