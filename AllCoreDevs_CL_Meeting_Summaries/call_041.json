    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 041",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce \"blobs\" as an efficient way to store data in transactions. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of this proposal, including reduced gas costs for users and improved scalability.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported across various clients, including Prysm and Lighthouse. A proposed solution was discussed for a specific issue affecting the `get_block_by_hash` function in the Beacon Chain API. Additionally, there was an update on **EIP-3675**, which aims to introduce \"sharding\" as part of Ethereum 2.0's scalability roadmap.\n\nDevelopment milestones were also covered during the meeting. The team is working towards a **September 15th** deadline for completing the finalization of EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) changes in preparation for the upcoming Merge event, which will integrate Proof-of-Stake with the existing Ethereum network. Testing updates included progress on simulating various scenarios to ensure smooth integration.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed during the meeting. Prysm and Lighthouse are both making steady advancements towards implementing EIP-4848 and other proposed changes. Notably, a new client called **Nethermind** has joined the testing pool, contributing its efforts in validating the Beacon Chain's functionality.\n\nAction items assigned to team members include finalizing EVM changes by September 15th and conducting thorough testing of sharding-related features before their integration into the mainnet. The next meeting is scheduled for [insert date], where further updates on these developments are expected."
