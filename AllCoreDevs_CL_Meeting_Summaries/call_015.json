    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 015",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for the Beacon Chain. The proposal aims to reduce gas costs by allowing clients to verify only a subset of blocks instead of all transactions. After thorough discussion, it was decided that EIP-4848 will be implemented in Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several were addressed during the call. Notably, **the `get_block_hash` function** issue has been resolved by updating the Beacon Chain to version v1.3.4. Additionally, a fix for the \"missing block\" problem was proposed using an updated implementation of the `process_slots` method.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates were also discussed during the meeting. The team is on track to complete **Phase 0's finalization** by Q2 2023, with ongoing efforts focused on stabilizing client implementations and resolving outstanding issues. Testing has been progressing steadily, with over 50% of Phase 1 test cases completed.\n\nClient implementation progress was a key topic during the call. The most notable updates include **Lighthouse v5.0**, which is now compatible with EIP-4848, and Prysm's ongoing work on implementing data availability sampling. Action items assigned to team members included reviewing outstanding issues for Phase 1 testing and finalizing client implementation plans.\n\nThe next meeting will focus on addressing remaining technical concerns and ensuring a smooth transition into the upcoming phase of development."
