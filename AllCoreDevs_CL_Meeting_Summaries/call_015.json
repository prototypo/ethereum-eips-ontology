A deadline of two weeks has been set for this task to be completed.\n\n\nA discussion was held regarding the implementation of sharding in Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1. The team is still working on resolving issues related to shard data availability and cross-shard communication.\n\n\nThe EL team reported that they are making progress with implementing the execution environment, but there were some concerns raised about its compatibility with the CL's new consensus algorithm."
