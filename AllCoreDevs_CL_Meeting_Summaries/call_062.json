    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 062",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for the Beacon Chain. The proposal aims to reduce gas costs by allowing clients to verify only a subset of blocks instead of all transactions. After thorough discussion, it was decided that EIP-4848 will be implemented in Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several were addressed during the meeting. Notably, **the issue with `get_block_randomness`** on Beacon Chain nodes has been resolved by updating the client implementation to use a more efficient method for generating random numbers. Additionally, discussions centered around proposed solutions for mitigating potential congestion in the network due to increased data availability sampling.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates were also discussed during the meeting. The team is working towards implementing **Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5**, which includes several key features such as sharding and improved scalability. Testing has been ongoing, with a focus on ensuring that clients can successfully communicate with each other using the new data availability sampling mechanism.\n\nClient implementation progress was also covered during the meeting. Several client teams reported significant advancements in implementing EIP-4848, including **Lighthouse** and **Nethermind**, which are expected to be fully compatible by the end of Q2 2023. Action items were assigned to each team member responsible for ensuring that all clients can successfully implement data availability sampling.\n\nThe next meeting is scheduled for [insert date] with a focus on reviewing client implementation progress, addressing any remaining technical issues, and finalizing plans for Phase 1.5 deployment."
