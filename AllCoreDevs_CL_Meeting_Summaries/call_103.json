    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 103",
    "Summary": "**Consensus Layer Call 103 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers met for call number 103, focusing on several critical topics that will shape the future of the network. The meeting began with a discussion around **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team reviewed proposals related to the upcoming Shanghai upgrade (Ethereum Protocol Version 1.2). Notably, they discussed the implementation details for the \"Difficulty Bomb Delay\" proposal (EIP-4345), which aims to delay the difficulty bomb by approximately two years.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues and bugs**, the developers addressed a critical issue with the Beacon Chain's gas limit calculation, causing inconsistencies in block production. A proposed solution involves adjusting the gas limit formula to account for varying network conditions. The team also discussed ongoing efforts to resolve an issue affecting validator performance on high-latency networks.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted progress toward implementing the Shanghai upgrade. The developers reported that all client implementations are making good headway, with several already in a state of \"feature freeze\" ahead of the planned deployment date (Q2 2023). Testing efforts continue to focus on ensuring seamless integration between Beacon Chain and Execution Layer components.\n\nThe meeting concluded with an overview of **Client implementation progress**, where each participating team reported their status. Notably, Lighthouse is nearing completion of its Shanghai upgrade work, while Prysm has made significant strides in implementing the necessary changes. The next call will cover finalizing action items related to testing and deployment timelines for the upcoming upgrade.\n\n**Action Items and Upcoming Deadlines**: Key tasks include completing EIP-4345 implementation across all clients by Q2 2023 and conducting thorough testing of Beacon Chain components before Shanghai's release date (Q2 2023)."
