    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 102",
    "Summary": "**Consensus Layer Call Meeting 102 Summary**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting was Protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently than traditional transactions. The discussion centered around the potential benefits and drawbacks of implementing blobs, including concerns about gas costs and compatibility issues.\n\nRegarding technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions, several clients reported encountering difficulties with **Beacon Chain version 1.2**, which was released recently. Specifically, some nodes were experiencing errors when processing attestations due to a bug in the implementation of the `process_attestation` function. The developers agreed on a patch that should resolve this issue.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, it was announced that **Beacon Chain version 1.3** is scheduled for release within two weeks. This new version will include several performance improvements and bug fixes. Additionally, the team reported progress on implementing **EIP-3076**, which introduces a new type of transaction called \"access lists\" to reduce gas costs.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed during this meeting. The developers noted that most clients are now compatible with Beacon Chain version 1.2, but some issues still need to be addressed before the next major release. Action items and upcoming deadlines were assigned to several team members to ensure timely completion of these tasks.\n\nIn summary, while there is ongoing work on various EIPs and client implementations, the primary focus remains on resolving technical issues related to Beacon Chain version 1.2 and preparing for the upcoming release of version 1.3."
