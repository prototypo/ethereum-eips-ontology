    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 022",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for the Beacon Chain. The proposal aims to reduce gas costs by allowing clients to sample blocks instead of verifying all transactions. After thorough discussion, it was decided that EIP-4848 will be implemented in Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, a critical **issue with the Bellatrix upgrade** (version 1.3) on the Beacon Chain was addressed. The problem arose due to an incorrect implementation of the `get_block_hash` function, which has been fixed by updating the codebase. Additionally, several minor bug fixes were discussed for various client implementations.\n\nThe development milestones and testing updates highlighted that **Phase 0's (Capella)** finalization is nearing completion with a target release date set for Q2 this year. The team also reported progress on implementing EIP-4848 in Phase 1.5, aiming to finalize it by the end of June. Testing has been ongoing across various client implementations.\n\nClient implementation progress showed that **Lighthouse** (version 4.0) and **Nethermind** have made significant strides towards supporting Bellatrix upgrade features. However, some clients are still experiencing issues with EIP-4848's data availability sampling functionality.\n\nAction items for the next meeting include finalizing Phase 1.5 implementation details and addressing any remaining technical concerns related to EIP-4848. The team will also review progress on testing and client implementations before setting a target release date for Bellatrix upgrade (version 1.3)."
