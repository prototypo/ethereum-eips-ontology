    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 137",
    "Summary": "**Consensus Layer Call 137 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers met for call number 137, focusing on several critical topics that will shape the future of the network. **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions** took center stage as the team reviewed proposals for EIP-4846 (Proto-Danksharding) and its implementation timeline. The consensus is to merge this protocol upgrade in a forthcoming release, with an estimated deployment date set for Q2 2023.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several **bugs and proposed solutions** were discussed during the call. Notably, the team addressed concerns related to the recent \"difficulty bomb\" issue, which has been mitigated through adjustments to the network's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Additionally, a fix was agreed upon for an edge case in the execution engine that could lead to incorrect gas metering.\n\nThe meeting also touched on **development milestones and testing updates**. The team is making progress toward implementing EIP-4846, with several clients already integrating the necessary changes. Notably, Prysm has completed its implementation of Proto-Danksharding, while Lighthouse is close behind. Testing for this upgrade will continue in the coming weeks.\n\nIn terms of **client implementation progress**, most major clients are on track to implement EIP-4846 by Q2 2023. However, some concerns were raised regarding the potential impact of this protocol change on network performance and security. The team agreed to monitor these aspects closely as testing continues.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** include finalizing the implementation timeline for Proto-Danksharding (EIP-4846) by the end of Q1 2023, with deployment expected in Q2 2023. Regular updates on client implementations will be provided during future calls to ensure a smooth transition to this new protocol upgrade."
