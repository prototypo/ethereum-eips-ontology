    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 031",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4848, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of this proposal in terms of scalability improvements.\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were also discussed at length. A notable issue was identified with regards to the handling of orphaned blocks under certain network conditions. Proposed solutions included adjusting parameters related to block propagation times and implementing additional checks for invalid transactions. The developers agreed on a plan to implement these changes in upcoming releases.\n\nRegarding **development milestones and testing updates**, it was reported that the development team is making progress towards releasing Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1, also known as \"Beacon Chain.\" A key milestone achieved during this meeting included completing the implementation of the Beacon Chain's finalization mechanism. Testing has been ongoing with a focus on ensuring stability under various network conditions.\n\n**Client implementation progress** was another area of discussion. The developers reviewed updates from several client implementations (e.g., Lighthouse, Prysm) and noted that most are now aligned in terms of their development timelines for Phase 1 deployment. However, some concerns were raised regarding the potential impact on performance due to differences between clients.\n\nThe meeting concluded with a list of **action items and upcoming deadlines**. Key tasks include finalizing EIP-4848's implementation details by the end of Q2 and completing testing procedures before releasing Beacon Chain Phase 1 in mid-Q3, pending further review and validation."
