    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 122",
    "Summary": "**Summary of Consensus Layer Call 122**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which aims to improve scalability by introducing a new type of transaction called \"blobs.\" The discussion centered around the proposal's implementation details, including its impact on gas costs and potential security implications. After thorough deliberation, the developers agreed to move forward with EIP-4848, targeting an activation date in **Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1** (also known as Bellatrix).\n\nRegarding technical issues, a critical bug was identified in the implementation of the \"difficulty bomb,\" which is designed to gradually increase mining difficulty over time. The developers proposed a fix and agreed on a timeline for its deployment, aiming to resolve this issue before **Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade**, scheduled for June 2023.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, the team reported progress toward completing the implementation of EIP-4848 in various client repositories (e.g., Prysm v2.9.0). Testing has been ongoing with a focus on ensuring compatibility across different clients. Notably, some concerns were raised regarding potential issues related to **gas limit adjustments** and their impact on network performance.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed during the call. The developers acknowledged that while significant work remains, they are making steady strides toward achieving key milestones for Ethereum 2.0's activation. Action items assigned include finalizing EIP-4848 documentation and conducting thorough testing to ensure a smooth transition upon its deployment.\n\nThe next meeting will focus on reviewing progress made since the last call and addressing any outstanding issues or concerns related to upcoming upgrades, including Shanghai and Bellatrix."
