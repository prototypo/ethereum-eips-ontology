    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 144",
    "Summary": "**Consensus Layer Call 144 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers met for call number 144, focusing on several critical topics that impact the network's development and stability.\n\n**Protocol Decisions and EIP Discussions**\nOne of the primary discussions centered around EIP-4846 (Proto-Danksharding), which aims to improve scalability by reducing gas costs. The team agreed to move forward with implementing this proposal in a future release, targeting Ethereum 2.0 version 1.3. Additionally, there was an update on EIP-4488 (Verkle Trees), which is expected to enhance data compression and reduce storage requirements.\n\n**Technical Issues, Bugs, and Proposed Solutions**\nThe team addressed several technical issues, including the ongoing problem with proposer slashing in Beacon Chain v0.12.1. A proposed solution involves adjusting the proposer's balance calculation, pending further review and testing. Another issue discussed was a bug affecting the execution of certain transactions on the Execution Layer.\n\n**Development Milestones and Testing Updates**\nThe meeting covered several development milestones, including progress toward implementing EIP-4846 in Ethereum 2.0 version 1.3. The team also reviewed updates from various client implementations (e.g., Lighthouse v5.4.0) and discussed ongoing testing efforts to ensure the stability of these releases.\n\n**Action Items and Upcoming Deadlines**\nThe meeting concluded with several action items, including further review of EIP-4846's implementation plan and a deadline for proposing solutions to the proposer slashing issue by Consensus Layer Call 145. The team also agreed on an upcoming testing schedule to validate client implementations before their release.\n\nOverall, this call highlighted significant progress toward improving Ethereum's scalability and addressing technical issues affecting its stability."
