    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 037",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blob transactions\" that can reduce gas costs for certain types of data. The discussion centered around the potential benefits and drawbacks of this proposal, including its impact on scalability and security.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several clients reported encountering problems with **Beacon Chain version 1.2**, which was released recently. Specifically, some users experienced difficulties when attempting to upgrade their nodes due to a bug in the `get_block_hash` function. The developers acknowledged this issue and are working on a patch release.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, the team is making progress towards **Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5**, which aims to increase the Beacon Chain's block time from 12 seconds to 6-7 seconds. This upgrade will improve network throughput and reduce latency. The developers are also working on implementing a new data structure called \" Merkle trees\" to optimize storage efficiency.\n\nClient implementation progress was reported by several teams, with **Lighthouse** being one of the most actively developed clients. Lighthouse is currently at version 5.2.0 and has made significant improvements in terms of performance and security.\n\nAction items for upcoming deadlines include finalizing EIP-4848's specification and implementing a patch release to address the Beacon Chain bug mentioned earlier. The next meeting will focus on reviewing progress towards Phase 1.5 and discussing further optimizations for the network."
