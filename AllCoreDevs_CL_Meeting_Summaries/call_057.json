    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 057",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' consensus layer meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for the Beacon Chain. The discussion centered around its potential impact on scalability and gas efficiency.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported in various client implementations, including Prysm (version 1.0.6) and Lighthouse (version v5.2.4). Proposed solutions involved updating dependencies to mitigate these issues. Additionally, the team discussed **Ethereum 2.0's** current state of development, with a focus on testing updates for upcoming milestones.\n\nClient implementation progress was also highlighted during the meeting. The Prysm client has made significant strides in implementing EIP-4848 and is expected to release version 1.0.7 soon. Lighthouse developers are working towards integrating data availability sampling as well. Notably, **Teku** (version v2.4) has been updated with improved performance metrics.\n\nAction items were assigned for the next meeting, including a review of EIP-4848's implementation in various clients and further discussion on its potential impact on Ethereum 2.0's overall architecture. The team also set an upcoming deadline to finalize testing updates before the **Ethereum 2.0 Merge** milestone.\n\nOverall, this meeting demonstrated significant progress towards implementing data availability sampling for improved scalability and gas efficiency. However, several technical issues remain unresolved, requiring continued collaboration among developers to ensure a smooth transition into Ethereum 2.0's next phase of development."
