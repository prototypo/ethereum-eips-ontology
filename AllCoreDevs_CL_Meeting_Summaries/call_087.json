    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 087",
    "Summary": "**Consensus Layer Call 87 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers met for call number 87, focusing on several critical topics that will shape the future of the network. **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions** took center stage as the team debated the implementation details of EIP-4846 (Proto-Danksharding). After a thorough discussion, it was decided to proceed with implementing this proposal in Ethereum's upcoming Shanghai hardfork (version 1.2), which is scheduled for release on April 12th.\n\nRegarding **technical issues and bugs**, several clients reported encountering problems related to the recent merge transition. The team acknowledged these concerns and proposed solutions to address them, including updates to client implementations and adjustments to network parameters. Notably, Lighthouse (version 5.2) has already implemented a fix for one of the identified issues.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted significant progress in preparing for Shanghai's release. The testnet is now fully functional with Proto-Danksharding enabled, allowing developers to thoroughly test their applications before the mainnet deployment. Additionally, several clients have made notable strides in implementing EIP-4846, including Prysm (version 2.0) and Teku (version 1.3).\n\n**Client implementation progress** showed that most major clients are on track with Proto-Danksharding support ahead of Shanghai's release date. However, some concerns were raised regarding the potential impact of this upgrade on network performance.\n\nThe meeting concluded with several **action items and upcoming deadlines**, including a review of client implementations by April 5th to ensure readiness for Shanghai's hardfork. The team will reconvene in two weeks to discuss any remaining issues and finalize preparations before the release date."
