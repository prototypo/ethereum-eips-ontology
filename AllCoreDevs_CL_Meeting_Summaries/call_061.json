    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 061",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for the Beacon Chain. The proposal aims to reduce gas costs by allowing clients to verify only a subset of blocks instead of all transactions. After thorough discussion, it was decided that this EIP will be implemented in Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several were addressed during the call. Notably, **the `get_block_hash` function** bug has been resolved with a patch to be included in upcoming client releases (version v1.3). Additionally, discussions around **gas limit adjustments for EVM execution**, which will impact Ethereum 2.0's Phase 2 rollout.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates were also discussed during the meeting. The team is on track to meet its target of completing **Phase 1.5 implementation** by Q4 this year (2023). Testing has been ongoing, with a focus on ensuring compatibility between clients implementing EIP-4848. Notably, the Lighthouse client's integration testing for Phase 1.5 showed promising results.\n\nClient implementation progress was also covered during the call. The **Lighthouse and Nimbus** teams reported significant advancements in their implementations of EIP-4848. However, some concerns were raised regarding potential issues with data availability sampling on certain hardware configurations.\n\nAction items assigned to team members include finalizing Phase 1.5 client releases by Q4 (2023) and conducting thorough testing for compatibility between clients implementing the new protocol changes."
