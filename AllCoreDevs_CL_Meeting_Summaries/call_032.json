    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 032",
    "Summary": "**Summary of MEETING_NUM - Eth2.0 Call**\n\nThe core developers discussed several crucial topics during this meeting, with a primary focus on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions** (Ethereum Improvement Proposals). The team reviewed the latest draft of EIP-4846, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently. After thorough discussion, it was decided to move forward with implementing this proposal in the upcoming Bellatrix upgrade.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues and bugs**, several concerns were raised regarding the performance of the Beacon Chain's proposer selection mechanism. It was proposed to implement a new algorithm called \"randomness beacon\" to improve randomness generation for proposers. This change is expected to be included in the next major release, Denial-of-Service (DoS) protection patch.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates**: The team discussed progress on implementing the Bellatrix upgrade, which aims to introduce several key features such as sharding and EVM upgrades. Testing has been ongoing for the past few weeks, with a focus on ensuring that all components are working correctly together. A timeline was set for completing this phase by **Q2 2023**.\n\nThe meeting also touched upon **Client implementation progress**, where it was reported that several clients (e.g., Lighthouse and Teku) have made significant strides in implementing the Bellatrix upgrade features. However, some concerns were raised regarding compatibility issues between different client implementations.\n\nLastly, a list of action items and upcoming deadlines was discussed to ensure timely completion of outstanding tasks. Key milestones include completing testing for Bellatrix by **Q2 2023** and finalizing EIP-4846 implementation in the same timeframe."
