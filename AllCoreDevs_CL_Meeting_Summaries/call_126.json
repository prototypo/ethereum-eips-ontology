    "Summary": "**Consensus Layer Call 126 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers met for call number 126, focusing on several critical topics that will shape the future of the network. The meeting began with a discussion around **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team reviewed proposals related to the upcoming Shanghai upgrade (Ethereum Protocol Version: 1.2). Notably, they discussed EIP-4844, which aims to improve data availability on Layer 2 solutions by introducing a new type of transaction called \"Proto-Danksharding.\" The proposal is expected to be finalized soon.\n\nMoving forward to **Technical issues and bugs**, the team addressed several pressing concerns, including an issue with the Beacon Chain's gas limit calculation. A proposed solution was discussed, which involves adjusting the gas limit formula to prevent potential chain splits. Additionally, a bug in the execution environment of Ethereum 2.0 (Ethereum Protocol Version: 1.1) was identified and assigned for resolution.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** were also covered during the meeting. The team reported progress on implementing EIP-4844 in various client implementations, including Prysm and Lighthouse. Testing is ongoing to ensure a smooth transition with the upcoming Shanghai upgrade. Furthermore, the developers discussed plans for post-Shanghai development, focusing on improving scalability and usability.\n\nLastly, **Client implementation progress** was reviewed, highlighting notable advancements from several clients. The team also assigned action items and set deadlines for resolving outstanding issues. Notably, the next call is scheduled to discuss EIP-4844's finalization and prepare for Shanghai's deployment (expected in April 2023)."
