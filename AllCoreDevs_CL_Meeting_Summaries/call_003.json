    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 003",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for the Beacon Chain. The proposal aims to reduce gas costs by allowing clients to verify only a subset of blocks instead of all transactions. After thorough discussion, it was decided that the implementation will proceed as planned.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several were reported across various client implementations. Notably, **Lighthouse** developers encountered an issue with incorrect block header validation, which has since been resolved in version 5.1.0. Meanwhile, **Nethermind** is working on a fix for a memory leak affecting its performance.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates highlighted the ongoing efforts to finalize EIP-4848 implementation across clients. The team aims to complete this task by Q2 of next year (2023). Additionally, there was discussion around updating the Ethereum 1.x client's compatibility with Beacon Chain changes in version **Ethereum 1.10**.\n\nClient implementation progress showed that most major implementations are on track for EIP-4848 integration. However, some concerns were raised regarding potential performance implications and gas cost savings estimates. To address these issues, a follow-up discussion is scheduled for the next meeting to review ongoing testing results.\n\nAction items assigned during this call include finalizing EIP-4848 implementation across all clients by Q2 2023 and conducting thorough testing of Beacon Chain changes in Ethereum 1.x version **Ethereum 1.10**."
