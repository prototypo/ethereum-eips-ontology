    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 028",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for the Beacon Chain. The proposal aims to reduce gas costs by allowing clients to verify only a subset of blocks instead of all transactions. After thorough discussion, it was decided that EIP-4848 will be implemented in Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several were addressed during the meeting. Notably, **the issue with `get_block_hash` being incorrectly calculated** has been resolved by updating the client implementation to use a more accurate method for calculating block hashes. Additionally, discussions around **optimizing memory usage in clients**, particularly for large-scale validators, highlighted potential improvements through caching and data compression.\n\nDevelopment milestones were also discussed during the meeting. The team is on track to meet its target of implementing EIP-4848 by Q2 2023 (version `altair-v1`). Testing updates included **successful completion** of Phase 0 testing with a focus on stress-testing large-scale validators, which will inform future development and optimization efforts.\n\nClient implementation progress was also covered. The team is working to resolve outstanding issues in the client implementations for Prysm and Lighthouse, aiming to achieve parity by Q2 2023 (version `altair-v1`). Action items include finalizing EIP-4848's specification and conducting thorough testing before its deployment.\n\nThe meeting concluded with a review of upcoming deadlines. The team is working towards implementing Phase 1.5 in the coming months, which will introduce data availability sampling for Beacon Chain clients."
