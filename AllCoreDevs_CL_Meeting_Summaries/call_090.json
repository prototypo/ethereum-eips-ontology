    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 090",
    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nIn our latest Ethereum Layer 2 core developers' meeting (MEETING_NUM), we focused on several critical topics that will shape the future of the network. The primary discussion centered around **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where we reviewed proposals for improving scalability, security, and usability.\n\nOne key proposal is the implementation of **Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559** (EIP-1559), which aims to reduce congestion on the mainnet by introducing a dynamic fee mechanism. We discussed potential issues with gas limit adjustments and agreed that further testing is necessary before finalizing its integration into the protocol. Another notable discussion revolved around **Layer 2 scaling solutions**, specifically Optimism's implementation of rollups, which showed promising results in reducing transaction costs.\n\nRegarding technical issues, we addressed a critical bug affecting some clients' ability to process transactions with high gas limits. The proposed solution involves updating affected clients and implementing additional checks for gas limit validation. We also reviewed the **development milestones** set forth by various teams working on Ethereum 2.0 (Serenity). Notably, the Beacon Chain's Phase 1 deployment is expected to occur within the next two weeks.\n\nIn terms of client implementation progress, we observed significant advancements in several implementations, including Prysm and Lighthouse. These updates have improved overall performance and are crucial for a smooth transition to Serenity. Finally, **action items** were assigned to various teams regarding testing, documentation, and code reviews related to EIP-1559 integration.\n\nThe next meeting is scheduled for Thursday (2022/07/14 at 10:00 ET), where we will continue discussing these topics in more detail and address any emerging concerns."
