    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 098",
    "Summary": "**Consensus Layer Call 98 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers met for call number 98, focusing on several critical topics that will shape the future of the network. **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions** took center stage as the team debated the merits of EIP-4846 (Proto-Danksharding), a proposed upgrade aimed at increasing scalability through improved data processing efficiency. After thorough discussion, it was decided to move forward with implementing this enhancement.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported in various client implementations, including **Geth** and **Nethermind**. The team reviewed these concerns and assigned action items for resolution within the next two weeks. Notably, a critical bug affecting data integrity on the Beacon Chain was identified and is being addressed by the developers.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, the call highlighted progress toward implementing EIP-4846 in **Prism** (version 0.9) and **Lighthouse** (version 5.1). Testing has commenced for both clients, with encouraging results so far. The team also discussed upcoming deadlines for completing these implementations.\n\nClient implementation progress was another key focus area during the call. As mentioned earlier, Geth and Nethermind are working to resolve their respective bugs, while Prism and Lighthouse continue testing EIP-4846 integration. Action items were assigned to ensure timely completion of these tasks.\n\nThe meeting concluded with a review of upcoming deadlines for implementing EIP-4846 in various clients (Prism by the end of Q2 2023) and resolving outstanding technical issues. The team will reconvene soon to assess progress toward these goals, ensuring that Ethereum's Consensus Layer continues to evolve efficiently and securely.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n* Resolve Geth bug within two weeks\n* Complete EIP-4846 implementation in Prism by Q2 2023\n\nNote: This summary is based on the provided context information."
