    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 020",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for the Beacon Chain. The proposal aims to reduce gas costs by allowing clients to verify only a subset of blocks instead of all transactions. After thorough discussion, it was decided that this EIP will be implemented in Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several were reported during the meeting. Notably, **the `get_block_hash` function** has been identified as a potential source of errors due to its implementation on top of the Beacon Chain's block hash calculation method. A proposed solution involves modifying this function to use the correct hashing algorithm for improved consistency.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates were also discussed during the meeting. The team is working towards **Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1.5**, which includes implementing EIP-4848, as well as other features such as sharding and data availability sampling. Testing has been ongoing with several clients participating in a testnet to ensure compatibility.\n\nClient implementation progress was also covered during the meeting. Several notable updates were reported from **Lighthouse** (version 4.1) and **Nethermind** (version 0.9), which have both implemented EIP-4848 for testing purposes. The team is working towards a unified client specification to ensure seamless integration across different implementations.\n\nAction items assigned during the meeting include reviewing the implementation of `get_block_hash` in various clients, as well as finalizing the Beacon Chain's block hash calculation method. Upcoming deadlines were also discussed, with **Phase 1.5 testing** scheduled for Q2 and a potential release date set for mid-year."
