    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 100",
    "Summary": "**Consensus Layer Call 100 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers met for their 100th call, focusing on several critical topics that will shape the future of the network. **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions** took center stage as the team debated the merits of EIP-4846 (Proto-Danksharding), a proposed upgrade to improve scalability. After thorough discussion, it was decided to move forward with implementing this enhancement in Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5.\n\nRegarding **technical issues and bugs**, several concerns were raised regarding the performance of the Beacon Chain under high load conditions. The team discussed potential solutions, including adjustments to gas pricing mechanisms and optimization strategies for node operators. A proposed fix was agreed upon, with a target implementation timeline set for Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted significant progress on client implementations. Lighthouse (version 4.3) and Prysm (version 6.8) have both demonstrated improved performance in recent benchmarking tests. The team also discussed the upcoming \"Merge\" event, which will integrate the Beacon Chain with the execution layer.\n\nIn terms of **client implementation progress**, several notable updates were shared during the call. Lighthouse developers reported success in implementing EIP-4846's Proto-Danksharding feature, while Prysm contributors made strides in optimizing their client for improved performance under high load conditions. The team also discussed ongoing efforts to improve testnets and facilitate more efficient testing processes.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** were outlined as follows: the implementation of EIP-4846 is expected by Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5, with a target release date set for Q3 this year. Node operators are encouraged to upgrade their clients in preparation for these changes. The team will reconvene next week to review progress and address any emerging concerns."
