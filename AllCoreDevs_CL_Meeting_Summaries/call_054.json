    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 054",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for the Beacon Chain. The proposal aims to reduce gas costs by allowing users to submit large datasets in batches, rather than individually. After thorough discussion, the team decided to move forward with implementing this feature.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several clients reported encountering problems related to **Beacon Node synchronization**. Specifically, some nodes were experiencing difficulties when syncing their state due to inconsistencies between different versions of the protocol. The developers proposed a solution involving an updated version of the `get_block_by_hash` function in the Beacon Chain API.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, the team is on track for **Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1** deployment timeline. Testing has been ongoing to ensure that all clients are compatible with each other and can successfully participate in the network. The developers also discussed plans for a **Phase 1 testnet**, which will allow them to simulate real-world scenarios before deploying on mainnet.\n\nClient implementation progress was another key focus area, with several teams reporting updates on their respective implementations of EIP-4848. Notably, Prysmatic Labs' client is expected to be the first to implement this feature, followed closely by Lighthouse and Teku clients. The team also discussed upcoming deadlines for implementing other critical features.\n\nAction items assigned during the meeting include finalizing a timeline for Phase 1 deployment and coordinating testing efforts among all participating teams."
