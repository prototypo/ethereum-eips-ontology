    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 142",
    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary - Consensus Layer Meeting 142**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) discussions and protocol decisions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4846**, which proposes the introduction of \"blobs\" to improve scalability. The core developers deliberated extensively on its implementation details, including gas costs and potential security implications.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported in various clients, such as Geth (version 1.10.8) and Besu (version 21.2.0). A proposed solution for one of these bugs involved updating the `geth` client to address a memory leak issue that could lead to node crashes under heavy load conditions.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, it was noted that **the Merge** timeline remains on track with an expected completion date in September 2023. The core developers also discussed ongoing testing efforts for various clients, including the `geth` client's integration tests.\n\nClient implementation progress saw significant discussion around **Ethereum 2.0**, specifically regarding the Beacon Chain and Shard Chains' interplay. Core developers acknowledged that further work is needed to ensure seamless communication between these components.\n\nAction items assigned during this meeting include:\n\n* Finalizing EIP-4846 implementation details\n* Resolving outstanding bugs in various clients\n* Continuing testing efforts for Ethereum 2.0\n\nOverall, the meeting highlighted ongoing progress toward improving scalability and security within the Ethereum network while emphasizing the need for continued collaboration to address technical challenges ahead of The Merge's scheduled completion date."
