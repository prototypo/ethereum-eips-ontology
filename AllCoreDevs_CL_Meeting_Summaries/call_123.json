    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 123",
    "Summary": "**Consensus Layer Call 123 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers met for call number 123, focusing on several critical topics that will shape the future of the network. **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions** took center stage as the team debated the merits of EIP-4846 (Proto-Danksharding), a proposal to improve scalability by reducing data transfer costs. After thorough discussion, it was decided to move forward with implementing this enhancement in Ethereum 2.0's Bellatrix upgrade.\n\nRegarding **technical issues and bugs**, several concerns were raised regarding the performance of the Beacon Chain under heavy load conditions. The team proposed solutions involving adjustments to gas limits and block times, which will be tested thoroughly before implementation. Additionally, a bug affecting the handling of attestations was identified and is being addressed by developers.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted significant progress on Bellatrix's development timeline. With the upgrade now scheduled for Q2 2023, focus shifted to ensuring that all necessary components are ready for deployment. Testing has been ongoing, with a recent milestone achieved in successfully completing a full-node testnet run using the latest client software.\n\nThe **client implementation progress** report showed steady advancements across various clients (e.g., Lighthouse and Teku). Notably, Lighthouse developers have made significant strides in optimizing their codebase for improved performance. As development continues towards Bellatrix's release date, core contributors will maintain close collaboration to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nLastly, **action items and upcoming deadlines** were discussed, with key milestones including the completion of EIP-4846 testing by March 15th and finalizing client implementation plans before April 1st."
