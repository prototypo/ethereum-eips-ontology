    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 118",
    "Summary": "**Consensus Layer Call 118 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers met for call number 118, focusing on several critical topics that will shape the future of the network. **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions** took center stage as the team reviewed proposals to enhance the Beacon Chain's security and efficiency. Notably, they discussed EIP-4846 (Proto-Danksharding), which aims to increase block capacity by 64 times through a novel data structure called \"proto-dankshard.\" The proposal is expected to be implemented in Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1.5.\n\n**Technical issues and proposed solutions** were also extensively discussed, with the team addressing concerns related to the recent Beacon Chain fork due to an issue with the Casper FFG (Friendly Finality Gadget) protocol. A fix has been developed and is currently being tested by several clients. Additionally, they explored ways to mitigate a potential vulnerability in the execution environment of Ethereum 2.0.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted significant progress on client implementation, particularly with Lighthouse and Prysm. Both clients have made substantial strides toward implementing EIP-4846 and are expected to be ready for Phase 1.5 by Q3 this year. The team also discussed the upcoming \"Bellatrix\" upgrade (Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1), which is scheduled for September.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** were assigned to several developers, focusing on finalizing EIP-4846 implementation details, testing the fix for the Casper FFG issue, and coordinating with clients to ensure a smooth transition to Bellatrix. The next Consensus Layer call will take place in two weeks' time, providing an opportunity for further discussion and progress updates.\n\nOverall, this meeting demonstrated significant momentum toward enhancing Ethereum's scalability and security features."
