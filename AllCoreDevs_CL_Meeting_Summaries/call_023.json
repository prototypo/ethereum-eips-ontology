    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 023",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on **Protocol Decisions and EIP Discussions**, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4848, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently. The discussion centered around the potential benefits and drawbacks of implementing this feature in the upcoming Shanghai upgrade (Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1). A consensus was reached to move forward with EIP-4848, subject to further review and testing.\n\n**Technical Issues, Bugs, and Proposed Solutions**\n\nSeveral technical issues were addressed during the meeting, including a bug affecting the Beacon Chain's proposer selection mechanism in Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1. The developers proposed a fix that involves modifying the `get_beacon_proposer_duties` function to correctly calculate duties for validators with multiple active committees.\n\n**Development Milestones and Testing Updates**\n\nThe meeting also covered updates on development milestones, including progress toward implementing EIP-4848 in the Goerli testnet. The developers reported that they are making good headway but need more time to complete testing before merging it into mainnet. Additionally, a timeline was discussed for releasing Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1 with Shanghai upgrade.\n\n**Client Implementation Progress**\n\nThe client implementation progress update highlighted ongoing work on implementing EIP-4848 in various clients (e.g., Lighthouse and Teku). The developers acknowledged that some challenges remain but are confident they will be resolved soon.\n\n**Action Items and Upcoming Deadlines**\n\nKey action items include finalizing the fix for the Beacon Chain bug, completing testing of EIP-4848 on Goerli testnet, and preparing for a potential Shanghai upgrade release in Q2 2023."
