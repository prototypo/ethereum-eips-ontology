    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 141",
    "Summary": "**Consensus Layer Call 141 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers met for call number 141, focusing on several critical topics that impact the network's development and stability.\n\n**Protocol Decisions and EIP Discussions**\nOne of the primary discussions centered around EIP-4846 (Proto-Danksharding), which aims to improve scalability by reducing gas costs. The team agreed to move forward with implementing this proposal in Ethereum 2.0, targeting a release date for phase 1 within Q3 2024. Another key discussion revolved around the upcoming Shanghai upgrade, scheduled for April 2024 (Ethereum 2.0 version: Bellatrix). This update will introduce several improvements and bug fixes.\n\n**Technical Issues, Bugs, and Proposed Solutions**\nThe team addressed a critical issue with the Beacon Chain's gas metering system, which was causing inconsistencies in block production times. A proposed solution involves adjusting the gas limit calculation to better align with expected usage patterns. Additionally, developers discussed ongoing efforts to resolve issues related to the Merge (Ethereum 2.0) transition and its impact on existing clients.\n\n**Development Milestones and Testing Updates**\nThe team reviewed progress toward completing phase 1 of Ethereum 2.0, which includes implementing a new consensus algorithm and sharding capabilities. The current timeline indicates that this milestone will be reached within the next few months (Q3 2024). In terms of testing updates, developers reported on ongoing efforts to validate client implementations for both Beacon Chain and Shard Chains.\n\n**Action Items and Upcoming Deadlines**\nThe meeting concluded with several action items assigned to team members. Key deadlines include completing phase 1 development by Q3 2024 (Ethereum 2.0 version: Bellatrix) and finalizing the Shanghai upgrade in April 2024."
