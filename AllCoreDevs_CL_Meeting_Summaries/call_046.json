    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce \"blob storage\" in the Beacon Chain. This feature aims to improve scalability by allowing for more efficient data processing. The discussion centered around its implementation details, including gas costs and potential security implications.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported across various clients, with notable mentions being **geth** (version 1.10.15) and **lighthouse** (version v5.2.0). Proposed solutions included patches for the identified vulnerabilities as well as updates to client configurations. The meeting also touched on development milestones, highlighting progress towards implementing EIP-4848 in upcoming releases.\n\nClient implementation progress was another key area of discussion. Developers reported advancements in integrating blob storage into their respective clients, with **Teku** (version 1.2.0) and **Nethermind** (version v1.3.4-beta.5) making notable strides. Testing updates were also shared, including the ongoing testing of EIP-4848 on testnets.\n\nAction items assigned during the meeting included reviewing proposed patches for identified bugs and finalizing implementation details for blob storage in client releases scheduled for Q2 2023. The next call is set to take place within two weeks' time, with a focus on addressing outstanding issues and providing updates on ongoing development efforts."
