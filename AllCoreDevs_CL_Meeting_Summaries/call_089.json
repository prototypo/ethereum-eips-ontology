    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 089",
    "Summary": "**Summary of Consensus Layer Call 89**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4846**, which proposes to introduce \"blobs\" as a new type of transaction data in the Ethereum network. The discussion centered around its potential benefits for scalability and gas efficiency improvements.\n\nRegarding technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions, the team addressed several pressing concerns. Notably, they discussed ongoing efforts to resolve **the `MAX_EXTRA_DATA_SIZE` issue**, which affects some clients' ability to process transactions with large extra data payloads. The developers also touched on a potential fix for this problem in upcoming versions of Go Ethereum (Geth) and Nethermind.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, the team reviewed progress toward implementing **Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1**, which includes Beacon Chain functionality. They discussed ongoing work to integrate the Bellatrix upgrade with the Merge protocol. Additionally, they covered recent improvements in testnet stability and performance metrics for various clients.\n\nClient implementation progress was also a key topic of discussion during this call. The developers reviewed updates from Geth (v1.10.x) and Nethermind (v0.17.x), highlighting their respective implementations' compatibility with the upcoming Merge protocol. Action items included finalizing EIP-4846's specification, resolving outstanding issues in client codebases, and coordinating testing efforts for Phase 1.\n\nThe meeting concluded with a reminder of an **upcoming deadline** to finalize Beacon Chain functionality before proceeding with further upgrades. The team will reconvene soon to review progress on these initiatives and address any emerging concerns or challenges."
