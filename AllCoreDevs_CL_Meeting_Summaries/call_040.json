    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 040",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which aims to improve data availability for rollups by introducing a new type of transaction called \"blob transactions.\" The discussion centered around the proposal's implementation details, including its impact on gas costs and potential security implications. A consensus was reached to proceed with implementing EIP-4848 in Ethereum 2.0.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several were discussed during the meeting. Notably, a **critical bug** affecting the Beacon Chain's attestations processing was identified and is being addressed by the developers. Additionally, concerns about the performance of the Casper FFG (Friendly Finality Gadget) consensus algorithm under high network loads led to discussions on potential optimizations.\n\nDevelopment milestones were also discussed during the meeting. The team reported progress toward implementing **Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1**, with a focus on completing the Beacon Chain and transitioning from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Testing updates included ongoing work on simulating network stress tests, which will help identify potential issues before deployment.\n\nClient implementation progress was also covered during the meeting. **Lighthouse** client developers reported significant advancements in implementing EIP-4848 support, while other clients like Prysm and Teku are working to catch up with similar implementations. Action items assigned include finalizing EIP-4848's specification by the end of Q2 2023.\n\nThe next call is scheduled for [insert date] when further updates on these developments will be shared."
