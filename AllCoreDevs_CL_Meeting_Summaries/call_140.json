    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 140",
    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nIn Meeting 140 of the Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers, several crucial topics were discussed and addressed. The primary focus was on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team deliberated on implementing a new mechanism to mitigate MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) issues in the Beacon Chain. Specifically, they explored the feasibility of introducing a \"MEV-boost\" feature, which would allow for more efficient extraction of value from transactions without compromising network security.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues and bugs**, the team identified several critical problems that need to be resolved before the upcoming Shanghai upgrade (Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1). Notably, they discussed a potential fix for the \" proposer slashing\" issue in the Beacon Chain's consensus layer, which could lead to significant improvements in network stability.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** were also covered during the meeting. The team confirmed that the Shanghai upgrade is on track for its scheduled release date (Q1 2023) with a focus on completing critical bug fixes and performance enhancements. Additionally, they reviewed progress toward implementing the \"Merge\" protocol update, which will eventually merge the Beacon Chain with the existing Ethereum mainnet.\n\n**Client implementation progress**, specifically regarding Lighthouse and Teku clients, was also discussed during the meeting. The team acknowledged that both clients are making good strides in implementing necessary changes for the Shanghai upgrade but emphasized the need to ensure seamless integration across all client implementations.\n\nLastly, **action items and upcoming deadlines** were outlined, with a focus on resolving outstanding technical issues before the Shanghai release date. Key action items include finalizing MEV-boost implementation details and completing critical bug fixes within the next two weeks."
