    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 038",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe recent Ethereum Consensus Layer core developers meeting focused on several critical topics, with a primary emphasis on protocol decisions and EIP discussions (1). A significant update was announced regarding versioning conventions for the consensus layer clients. From now onwards, versions will be more meaningful, indicating major milestones in development. Specifically, any client version under V0.11 is considered experimental, except for v0.11.0 which had a critical bug and has since been fixed to ensure backwards compatibility.\n\nTechnical issues were also discussed during the meeting (2). The team acknowledged that some clients may experience difficulties with certain versions due to bugs or incompatibilities. To address these concerns, proposed solutions are being explored, including updates to client implementations and potential patches for affected versions. Notably, v0.11.0 has been deemed stable following its rapid fix.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates were also covered (3). The team is working towards a more structured approach to versioning, which will enable better tracking of progress and identify areas requiring improvement. Testing efforts are ongoing, with the goal of achieving higher levels of stability across all client implementations.\n\nClient implementation progress was discussed in detail during the meeting (4). Several clients have made significant strides in recent weeks, including improvements in performance and bug fixes. However, some challenges persist, particularly regarding compatibility between different versions of the consensus layer protocol.\n\nAction items and upcoming deadlines were also outlined during the discussion (5). The team is working towards a more coordinated approach to development, with regular check-ins scheduled for future meetings. Key milestones include completing versioning updates and addressing outstanding technical issues before proceeding with further development."
