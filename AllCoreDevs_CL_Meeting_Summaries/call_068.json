    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on implementing Ethereum 2.0 (Serenity). The team discussed the upcoming Berlin hardfork, which is scheduled for April 2021 (version: `Berlin/phase-0`). A key decision was made to delay the activation of the Difficulty Bomb until after the Merge.\n\n**Technical Issues and Proposed Solutions**\n\nSeveral technical issues were addressed during the meeting. Notably, a bug in the Beacon Chain's proposer selection mechanism was identified and proposed solutions discussed. The team also reviewed progress on implementing the `deposit` EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal), which will enable users to deposit ETH into the Ethereum 2.0 contract.\n\n**Development Milestones and Testing Updates**\n\nThe meeting highlighted several development milestones, including the completion of the Beacon Chain's proposer selection mechanism implementation (`version: v1.3`). The team also discussed testing updates for the Merge, with a focus on ensuring seamless integration between the Beacon Chain and the Ethereum 1.x chain.\n\n**Client Implementation Progress**\n\nSeveral client implementations were reviewed during the meeting, including Lighthouse (version `v0.5`) and Prysm (`v2.4`). While progress was noted in both clients, concerns regarding interoperability and testing were raised.\n\n**Action Items and Upcoming Deadlines**\n\nThe team assigned several action items to ensure timely completion of key tasks. Notably, the Merge is expected to occur within Q3 2021 (tentative timeline). The next meeting will focus on reviewing progress toward this goal and addressing any emerging technical issues."
