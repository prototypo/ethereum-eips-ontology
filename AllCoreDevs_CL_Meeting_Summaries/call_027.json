    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 027",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Consensus Layer Core Developers Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' call focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for the Beacon Chain. The proposal aims to reduce gas costs by allowing clients to verify only a subset of blocks instead of all transactions. After thorough discussion, it was decided that this EIP will be implemented in Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several were reported during the meeting. Notably, **the `get_block_hash` function** has been identified as a potential source of errors due to its implementation in different clients. A proposed solution involves standardizing this function across all implementations. Additionally, discussions centered around resolving an issue with **gas limit calculations**, which could lead to inconsistencies between client versions.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates were also discussed during the meeting. The team is working towards a **Phase 1.5 release candidate** by mid-March, with several clients already in various stages of implementation. Notably, Lighthouse has made significant progress, while Prysm's development pace remains steady. Testing efforts are ongoing to ensure compatibility and resolve any outstanding issues.\n\nAction items assigned during the meeting include finalizing EIP-4848 documentation and conducting thorough testing for Phase 1.5 release candidates. The team is also working towards resolving technical debt related to gas limit calculations, with a deadline set for **the end of March**. Overall, progress on Ethereum's Consensus Layer continues at pace, driven by the collaborative efforts of its core developers.\n\nKey metrics and timelines mentioned during the meeting include:\n\n* Phase 1.5 release candidate: mid-March\n* EIP-4848 documentation completion: early April\n* Gas limit calculation resolution deadline: end of March"
