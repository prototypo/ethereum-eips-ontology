    "Meeting": "Consensus Layer Call 136",
    "Summary": "**Summary of Consensus Layer Call 136**\n\nThe primary focus area for this call was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team reviewed several proposals, including EIP-4846 (Efficient Storage) and EIP-5593 (Difficulty Bomb Delay). The discussion centered around potential implications on network performance and security. After thorough review, it was decided to move forward with implementing both EIPs in a future release.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, the team discussed an ongoing issue related to the \"difficulty bomb\" mechanism, which is expected to be resolved by implementing EIP-5593 as mentioned earlier. Additionally, there were updates on addressing memory safety vulnerabilities discovered during testing of upcoming releases (Goerli testnet v9.1).\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted progress toward releasing a new version of the Goerli testnet (v10). This release is expected to include several bug fixes and performance enhancements. The team also discussed plans for conducting thorough security audits before deploying any changes.\n\nThe **Client implementation progress** section reported that most clients are on track with implementing EIP-4846, but there were concerns raised regarding the compatibility of some client implementations. It was agreed upon to continue monitoring this closely as more information becomes available.\n\nLastly, several action items and upcoming deadlines were discussed during the call:\n\n* Implementing EIPs 4846 and 5593 in a future release\n* Resolving difficulty bomb mechanism issues by implementing EIP-5593\n* Releasing Goerli testnet v10 with bug fixes and performance enhancements"
