    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 78",
    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nIn Meeting #78 of Ethereum Core Developers, several crucial discussions took place regarding protocol decisions and EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals). Notably, **EIP-2387**, which aims to improve the Ropsten testnet's performance, was moved forward ahead of mainnet. Additionally, a time-based approach for handling network congestion was deemed more suitable than previously discussed alternatives (**Decision 78.2**).\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, no major concerns were raised during this meeting. However, **Ethereum networking issues**, which are often ad-hoc in nature, sparked an interesting discussion about standardization within the protocol itself.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, there was a brief mention that EIP-2456 would benefit from a time-based approach to handling network congestion (**Decision 78.2**). No specific timelines or metrics were provided for this update.\n\nClient implementation progress saw no notable changes during this meeting. However, it's worth mentioning that the discussion around **Ethereum Magicians thread**, where EIP-1962 will be further discussed, indicates ongoing efforts to refine and improve various aspects of Ethereum protocol development.\n\nAction items from Meeting #78 include continuing discussions on EIPs in relevant threads (e.g., EthMagician) and implementing changes related to Ropsten's performance improvement. Overall, while this meeting focused primarily on refining existing proposals rather than introducing new ones, it demonstrates the ongoing commitment among core developers to improve Ethereum protocol efficiency and scalability.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n- Continue EIP discussions in relevant threads (e.g., EthMagician)\n- Implement changes related to Ropsten's performance improvement"
