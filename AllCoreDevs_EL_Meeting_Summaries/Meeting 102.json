    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 102",
    "Summary": "**Summary of All Core Devs Meeting 102**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which aims to increase the block gas limit by introducing a new data structure called \"Proto-Danksharding\". The proposal has been met with both enthusiasm and skepticism from core developers. After an in-depth discussion, it was decided that EIP-4844 will be implemented as part of Ethereum's upcoming Shanghai hardfork (version 1.2), scheduled for April 2023.\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were also discussed at length during the meeting. A critical bug affecting the execution engine in Geth client version 1.10 was identified and a fix has been implemented by the development team. Additionally, concerns regarding gas costs associated with certain operations on Ethereum's mainnet have led to discussions around potential optimizations.\n\nIn terms of **development milestones and testing updates**, it was announced that the Goerli test network will be upgraded to version 1.2 in preparation for Shanghai hardfork deployment. This upgrade is expected to improve overall performance, security, and compatibility with upcoming EIPs.\n\n**Client implementation progress** showed significant advancements across various clients, including Geth (version 1.10) and Besu (version 21.3). These updates have improved the stability and efficiency of Ethereum's execution layer.\n\nLastly, **action items and upcoming deadlines** were outlined for core developers to focus on before the Shanghai hardfork deployment in April 2023. Key tasks include finalizing EIP-4844 implementation details, completing client upgrades, and conducting thorough testing across all clients."
