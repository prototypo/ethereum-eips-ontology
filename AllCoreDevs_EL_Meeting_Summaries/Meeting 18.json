    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 18",
    "Summary": "**All Core Devs Meeting 18 Summary**\n\nThe most impactful development discussed during this meeting was the ongoing discussion around EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) 4844, which proposes a significant change to Ethereum's gas pricing mechanism. The proposal aims to reduce congestion and improve scalability by introducing a new type of gas metering called \"dynamic fee\". After thorough discussions, it was decided that further testing is required before making any decisions.\n\nRegarding technical issues, the team addressed several bugs in various clients, including Geth (version 1.10.8) and Parity (version 2.7.0). A proposed solution for a critical bug affecting gas metering accuracy has been implemented in both clients. The fix is expected to be rolled out soon.\n\nIn terms of development milestones, the team discussed the upcoming Berlin hardfork scheduled for April 15th. This update will include several EIPs aimed at improving Ethereum's security and usability. Notably, EIP-1559, which introduces a new fee market design, has been delayed due to ongoing testing issues.\n\nClient implementation progress was also covered during this meeting. The Geth team reported that they are on track with their Berlin hardfork preparations, while the Parity team is still working through some outstanding issues related to gas metering accuracy.\n\nAction items and upcoming deadlines were discussed briefly. A key takeaway from these discussions is that all core developers should prioritize testing EIP-4844 in preparation for potential deployment. The next meeting will focus on reviewing test results and making a final decision regarding the proposal's implementation."
