    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nAt Meeting 14 of Ethereum Core Devs, several crucial topics were discussed and addressed. The primary focus was on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team deliberated on a proposed change to the gas limit formula (EIP-4844). After thorough discussion, it was decided that this proposal would be implemented in the upcoming Berlin hardfork (Berlin v1.0), scheduled for April 15th.\n\n**Technical issues and bugs were also addressed**, with particular attention given to resolving an issue affecting the Geth client's ability to handle large numbers of transactions per block. A proposed solution, which involves modifying the transaction queueing mechanism, was discussed in detail and is expected to be implemented soon (targeted for Berlin v1.0).\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted progress on several fronts: the Go Ethereum (Geth) client has reached a milestone with its implementation of EIP-1559, while Parity's development team reported significant advancements towards implementing this protocol upgrade as well.\n\nRegarding **client implementation progress**, it was noted that all major clients are working diligently to implement Berlin v1.0 features and bug fixes in time for the scheduled hardfork date. The meeting also touched on several action items and upcoming deadlines, including a review of EIP-1559's gas pricing mechanism by April 10th.\n\n**Action Items**\n\n* Review EIP-1559 gas pricing mechanism: due April 10th\n* Implement proposed solution to Geth client issue: targeted for Berlin v1.0 (April 15th)\n* Finalize implementation details for EIP-4844 and other Berlin hardfork features\n\nThese developments underscore the ongoing efforts of Ethereum's core development team towards improving network scalability, security, and usability."
