    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 162",
    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nIn our latest Ethereum L1 Layer core developers' meeting (MEETING_NUM), we focused on several critical aspects of the protocol's development and implementation. The primary discussion centered around **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where we reviewed proposals for upcoming changes to improve scalability, security, and usability.\n\nOne key proposal was the adoption of EIP-4844, which aims to enhance sharding capabilities by introducing a new type of transaction called \"blobs.\" This change is expected to significantly boost throughput while maintaining low latency. The discussion revolved around its implementation details, including potential gas costs and compatibility with existing clients. After thorough review, we decided to move forward with the proposal.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, several concerns were raised regarding client stability under high loads. Specifically, some users reported instances of \"reorgs\" (chain reorganizations) due to inconsistent block propagation times between nodes. To address this issue, developers suggested implementing a more robust synchronization mechanism for clients, which is currently being tested.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted the progress made on sharding implementation, with several testnets already up and running. The team reported that they are working towards integrating EIP-4844 into these testnets by **June 1st**, allowing us to evaluate its performance in a real-world setting.\n\nLastly, we touched upon **Client implementation progress** and assigned action items for each client developer to ensure timely integration of the proposed changes. We also set an upcoming deadline (**May 31st**) for clients to report their readiness status regarding EIP-4844 adoption."
