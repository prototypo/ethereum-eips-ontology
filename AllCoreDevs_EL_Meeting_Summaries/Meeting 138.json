    "Summary": "**AllCoreDevs Meeting 138 Summary**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around EIP discussions and protocol decisions, with a significant emphasis on **Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844**, which aims to increase the block gas limit by introducing a new data structure. The proposal has garnered substantial interest among developers, with several key stakeholders weighing in on its potential impact.\n\nRegarding technical issues, the team discussed ongoing efforts to resolve a critical bug affecting Ethereum's **Beacon Chain** (version 1.3). Developers acknowledged that this issue requires immediate attention and proposed solutions are being explored. Additionally, there was an update on the status of EIP-4844 implementation in various client implementations.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, it was reported that the **Go Ethereum (Geth) team** has made significant progress with version 1.10.8, which includes several bug fixes and performance enhancements. The testnet for this release is expected to go live soon. Furthermore, there were discussions around upcoming deadlines for implementing EIP-4844 in client implementations.\n\nClient implementation progress was also a key topic of discussion during the meeting. **Nethermind** (version 1.10) has made notable strides with its integration of EIP-4844 and is expected to be one of the first clients to implement this proposal. Other clients, such as Geth and Besu, are working towards similar milestones.\n\nAction items from the meeting include:\n\n* Finalizing a timeline for implementing EIP-4844 across client implementations\n* Resolving the critical bug affecting Ethereum's Beacon Chain (version 1.3)\n* Providing regular updates on testing progress for version 1.10.8 of Geth\n\nOverall, this meeting highlighted significant developments in protocol decisions and technical issues, underscoring the importance of timely resolution to ensure a smooth transition towards EIP-4844 implementation across client implementations."
