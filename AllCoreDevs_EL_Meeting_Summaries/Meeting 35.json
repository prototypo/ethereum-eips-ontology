    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes the introduction of a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" to improve scalability. The discussion centered around addressing concerns regarding gas costs, security implications, and potential interactions with existing protocols.\n\nIn terms of technical issues, several bugs were reported in various clients, including Geth (version 1.10.8) and Parity (version 2.7.0). A proposed solution for the \"difficulty bomb\" issue was also discussed, which aims to mitigate the impact on network congestion by adjusting the difficulty adjustment period.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates revealed that several teams are working towards implementing **Ethereum 2.0**, with notable progress in client implementation. The Beacon Chain (version 1.4) is nearing completion, while other clients like Prysm (version 3.5.0) continue to advance their implementations.\n\nAction items and upcoming deadlines include a review of EIP-4848 by the end of <DATE> and further discussion on the difficulty bomb solution in an upcoming meeting. Additionally, several teams are expected to provide updates on client implementation progress within the next two weeks.\n\nOverall, this meeting highlighted significant advancements towards improving Ethereum's scalability and security features while addressing pressing technical issues. The focus on EIP-4848 and its potential impact underscores the importance of careful consideration and collaboration among core developers in shaping the future of the network."
