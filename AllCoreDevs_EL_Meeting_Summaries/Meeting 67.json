    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of this proposal in terms of scalability improvements.\n\nIn other technical areas, several bugs were reported across various clients, including Geth and Parity. A notable issue was identified with **Geth 1.10**, which required an urgent fix to prevent a potential data corruption bug. Additionally, discussions revolved around the implementation of **EIP-1559** in client versions, particularly regarding gas limit adjustments.\n\nDevelopment milestones were also discussed during the meeting. The team is working towards implementing **Shanghai hardfork**, with a target deployment date set for Q2 2023. Testing updates included progress on **Goerli testnet**, which will serve as a staging ground before mainnet deployments.\n\nClient implementation progress was another key area of discussion, focusing primarily on Geth and Parity implementations. The team is working to ensure that both clients are aligned with the latest protocol changes, including EIP-4848 and EIP-1559.\n\nAction items from this meeting include finalizing the Shanghai hardfork deployment timeline and addressing outstanding technical issues across various client versions."
