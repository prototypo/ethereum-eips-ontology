    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes the introduction of \"blobs\" to improve scalability. The discussion centered around addressing concerns regarding gas costs and potential security implications.\n\nRegarding technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions, the team addressed an ongoing problem with **gas limit calculations** in certain scenarios. A patch was proposed by a developer, pending further review and testing. Additionally, there were discussions about optimizing memory usage for Ethereum 2.0 clients to alleviate storage constraints on nodes.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates highlighted progress toward implementing **Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1**, with several client implementations making significant strides in compatibility and performance. Notably, the Prysm Beacon Chain has reached a milestone of over 10% test coverage for its codebase. The team also discussed upcoming deadlines for completing critical components necessary for Ethereum's transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS).\n\nClient implementation progress was another key area of focus during this meeting. Lighthouse and Teku clients have made notable improvements in their implementations, with both showing significant advancements toward full compatibility. However, the discussion highlighted ongoing challenges related to **interoperability** between different client versions.\n\nAction items from the meeting include further review of EIP-4848 by a working group and continued testing for Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1 components. The team also agreed on an upcoming deadline for completing critical PoS-related tasks, with specific targets set for each component's completion within the next two weeks."
