    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes the introduction of a new data structure called \"blobs\" to improve scalability. The discussion centered around its implementation details, including the potential impact on gas costs and network congestion.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported in various clients, including Geth (version 1.10.11) and Parity (version 2.7.0). A proposed solution for one of these bugs involved updating the `keccak256` function to use a more efficient algorithm. The meeting also touched on ongoing development milestones, with an update from the Ropsten testnet indicating that it is now running version 1.10.11 of Geth.\n\nClient implementation progress was another key area discussed during the meeting. It appears that Parity's client has made significant strides in implementing EIP-1559 (version 2.7.0), which introduces a new fee market to improve network efficiency. However, some concerns were raised regarding potential issues with gas costs and transaction prioritization.\n\nAction items assigned from this meeting include reviewing the implementation details of EIP-4848 and providing feedback within two weeks. Additionally, developers are tasked with addressing the reported bugs in various clients by implementing proposed solutions or alternative fixes. The next meeting is scheduled to take place in [insert timeframe], where further discussion on these topics will likely occur.\n\nOverall, this meeting highlighted ongoing efforts towards improving Ethereum's scalability and efficiency through protocol upgrades and client development."
