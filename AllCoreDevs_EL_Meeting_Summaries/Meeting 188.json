    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary: Execution Layer Meeting 188 [2024-05-23]**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4846, which aims to increase the block gas limit. The developers discussed potential issues related to the proposal's implementation, including its impact on network congestion and scalability.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, several clients reported encountering problems with EVM opcode execution. Specifically, Go-ethereum (Geth) version 1.12.0-beta.2 exhibited an issue where certain opcodes would cause a stack underflow error when executed in specific scenarios. The developers agreed to investigate further and propose fixes.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted the progress made by various clients towards implementing EIPs, including Geth's ongoing work on EIP-4846 integration. Additionally, Prysmatic Labs' client reported significant performance improvements with its latest release (version 1.2.0-beta). The meeting also touched upon **Client implementation progress**, noting that several clients are nearing completion of their respective implementations for the upcoming Berlin hardfork.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** were discussed to ensure timely resolution of outstanding issues. Notably, a deadline was set for EIP-4846's finalization by June 1st, with developers expected to submit any necessary changes or updates before then. The meeting concluded with an emphasis on continued collaboration among clients to address the pressing technical concerns and advance Ethereum's development roadmap.\n\nOverall, this meeting underscored the ongoing efforts of Execution Layer core developers in addressing critical issues and implementing key upgrades for the network's growth and scalability."
