    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 12",
    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nAt Meeting 12 of Ethereum Execution Layer core developers, several crucial topics were discussed and addressed. The primary focus was on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team deliberated over proposed changes to improve network scalability and security.\n\nOne key discussion centered around EIP-4848 (Proto-Danksharding), which aims to enhance sharding capabilities by introducing a new type of transaction, Proto-Shard Transactions. The proposal has been updated to version 2, addressing concerns regarding gas costs and implementation complexity. A consensus was reached on moving forward with the revised protocol.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, several client-specific problems were identified and discussed. For instance, a bug in Geth's (version 1.10.x) handling of Proto-Shard Transactions led to an agreement that a patch would be implemented as soon as possible. Additionally, discussions around the implementation of EIP-1559 (London Hardfork) continued, with attention given to ensuring seamless integration across various clients.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted progress in client implementations. The Goerli testnet has been upgraded to version 1.10.x, allowing for more comprehensive testing of Proto-Shard Transactions. Furthermore, the team acknowledged that a significant portion (around 70%) of the necessary code changes have already been implemented across various clients.\n\nLastly, **Action items and upcoming deadlines** were outlined, with specific attention given to completing EIP-4848 implementation by the end of Q2 2023. The next meeting is scheduled for [insert date], where progress will be reviewed, and further discussions on these topics are expected to continue."
