    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of this proposal in terms of scalability improvements.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported across various clients, including Geth and Parity. A notable issue was identified with regards to **gas pricing**, which led to a proposed solution involving adjustments to gas limits for certain types of transactions. Additionally, there was discussion around the implementation of **EIP-1559** in relation to its interaction with EIP-4848.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, it was reported that several clients are nearing completion of their implementations of **Beacon Chain Phase 1**, a crucial step towards Ethereum's transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). The timeline for this phase is expected to be around Q2 <YEAR>, with ongoing testing efforts focused on ensuring the stability and security of the new protocol.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed, highlighting notable advancements in **Geth**'s support for EIP-4848. Furthermore, Parity's development team reported significant strides towards implementing their own version of this proposal.\n\nAction items assigned during the meeting include a review of gas pricing adjustments by the end of <MONTH>, with an expected update on client implementation progress scheduled for the next meeting."
