    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 88",
    "Summary": "**Summary of All Core Devs Meeting 88**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) related to sharding, specifically EIP-4844. The core devs discussed the latest developments in implementing data availability sampling, which is crucial for achieving scalability through sharding. They also reviewed proposals from various contributors, including an update on the \"sharded gas\" concept.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues and bugs**, a notable discussion centered around fixing a critical issue with the `EVMC` (Ethereum Virtual Machine Client) interface in Goerli testnet. This bug was causing inconsistencies between different client implementations of Ethereum's execution layer, which could have far-reaching implications for network stability if left unaddressed.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted progress on implementing EIP-4844 in various clients, including Geth (version 1.10.8) and Besu (version 21.2). The core devs also discussed the upcoming \"Berlin\" hardfork, which is scheduled for April 2023. This update will include several key improvements to Ethereum's execution layer.\n\n**Client implementation progress** showed that most clients are on track with implementing EIP-4844 features and fixes. However, some concerns were raised regarding potential compatibility issues between different client versions post-Berlin hardfork.\n\nThe meeting concluded with a list of **action items and upcoming deadlines**, including finalizing the Berlin hardfork details by March 2023 and conducting thorough testing to ensure smooth implementation across all clients."
