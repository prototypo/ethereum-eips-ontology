    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 40",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of this proposal in terms of scalability improvements for layer 2 solutions.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several clients reported ongoing struggles with syncing large datasets due to memory constraints. A proposed solution involves implementing **EIP-3540**, which would allow nodes to store data on disk instead of RAM. This change is expected to alleviate the issue but requires further testing before implementation.\n\nDevelopment milestones were also discussed during the meeting. The team working on Ethereum 2.0's Beacon Chain reported progress in deploying a new version, with **version 1.3** scheduled for release soon. Additionally, there was an update on the status of the Merge (also known as \"The Switch\") \u2013 the process to combine Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanisms.\n\nClient implementation progress varied across different implementations. Geth reported success in implementing EIP-4848's blob functionality, while Besu faced challenges with syncing large datasets due to memory constraints similar to other clients. Action items included further testing of proposed solutions for the syncing issue and finalizing plans for deploying Ethereum 2.0.\n\nThe meeting concluded without setting specific deadlines but emphasized that progress toward The Merge is ongoing."
