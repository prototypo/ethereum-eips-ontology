    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 164",
    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nAt Meeting 164 of Ethereum Execution Layer core developers, several crucial topics were discussed and addressed. The primary focus was on **Protocol Decisions and EIP Discussions**, where the team deliberated over proposed changes to improve network efficiency and scalability.\n\nOne key discussion centered around EIP-4846 (Proto-Danksharding), which aims to enhance sharding capabilities by introducing a new type of transaction, Proto-Shard Transactions. The proposal has been updated to version 2, addressing concerns raised during the previous meeting. A consensus was reached on implementing this upgrade in Ethereum's upcoming Shanghai hardfork.\n\nRegarding **Technical Issues and Bugs**, several outstanding problems were reviewed, including issues related to gas pricing and block propagation times. Proposed solutions included adjustments to gas limits and modifications to the network protocol for more efficient data transmission. The team also discussed potential fixes for a known bug affecting client synchronization with the Ethereum mainnet.\n\n**Development Milestones and Testing Updates**: Progress on implementing EIP-4846 was reported, with several clients already integrating the new transaction type into their codebases. Notably, Geth has made significant strides in this regard, while Besu is expected to follow suit shortly. The team also discussed ongoing testing efforts for Shanghai hardfork compatibility.\n\n**Action Items and Upcoming Deadlines**: Key action items include finalizing EIP-4846 implementation across all clients by the end of Q2 2023 and conducting thorough testing before the scheduled Shanghai hardfork in June."
