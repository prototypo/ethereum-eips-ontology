    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of this proposal in reducing congestion on the network.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several clients reported encountering problems related to **gas pricing** inconsistencies across different implementations. A proposed solution involves revising the gas price calculation algorithm to ensure consistency among all nodes. Additionally, a bug affecting the handling of **ERC-20 token transfers** was identified and is being addressed by developers.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, several clients are nearing completion on implementing **Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1**, with Goerli testnet expected to be upgraded soon (targeting mid-March). The team also discussed the upcoming merge between Ethereum's current proof-of-work chain and its Beacon Chain.\n\nClient implementation progress was a key topic of discussion, particularly regarding the integration of new features such as **sharding**. Several clients reported making significant strides in implementing sharded execution environments, with some already testing on testnets.\n\nAction items assigned during this meeting include revising gas price calculations to ensure consistency across all nodes and finalizing EIP-4848 for implementation. The next meeting is scheduled for [insert date], where the team will continue discussing these topics and address any emerging concerns or issues."
