    "Summary": "**Execution Layer Meeting 201 Summary**\n\nThe recent Execution Layer core developer meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4844**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for Ethereum's execution layer. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of improved scalability and reduced gas costs associated with this proposal.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several clients reported ongoing struggles with **gas limit optimization** in their implementations. Specifically, Geth developers noted that they are still working on resolving a bug affecting gas limits when using certain types of transactions. The team is aiming to resolve the issue by version 1.10.23.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, it was announced that the **Berlin hardfork** (version 12) will be deployed in approximately two weeks' time. This update includes several key improvements, including a fix for the previously mentioned gas limit optimization bug. Additionally, developers reported progress on implementing EIP-4844, with an expected completion timeline of Q2 this year.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed during the meeting. Parity and Geth clients are both actively working towards integrating EIP-4844 into their codebases. Notably, Parity has made significant strides in recent weeks, with a functional prototype already available for testing purposes.\n\nAction items from the meeting include finalizing the Berlin hardfork deployment timeline and continuing to address gas limit optimization issues across client implementations. The next Execution Layer core developer meeting is scheduled for [insert date], where further progress on these initiatives will be discussed."
