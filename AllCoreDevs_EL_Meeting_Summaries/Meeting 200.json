    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting 200 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting #200 focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4848 (Base Fee Upgrade). The proposal aims to improve the efficiency of transactions by introducing a new type of data structure called \"blob\" which can be used for various purposes such as storing arbitrary binary data. After thorough discussion, it was decided that the upgrade will proceed with some modifications and is expected to go live in Ethereum 2.0 (Serenity) phase.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported across different clients including Geth, Parity, and Besu. The team discussed proposed solutions for these problems, focusing on implementing fixes as soon as possible without introducing new regressions. Notably, the meeting highlighted a critical issue with gas pricing in EIP-1559 which is currently being addressed.\n\nThe development milestones and testing updates revealed that Ethereum 2.0's Beacon Chain has reached an impressive milestone of over 10 million validators online. The team also discussed progress on client implementation, specifically mentioning improvements to Geth's performance and Parity's integration with the upcoming EIP-4848 upgrade.\n\nAction items assigned during this meeting include finalizing the Base Fee Upgrade (EIP-4848) by April 15th and addressing gas pricing issues in EIP-1559. The team also agreed on conducting a thorough review of client implementations to ensure they are aligned with the latest protocol changes.\n\nOverall, the meeting demonstrated significant progress towards Ethereum's upgrade roadmap while emphasizing the importance of resolving technical challenges promptly to maintain network stability."
