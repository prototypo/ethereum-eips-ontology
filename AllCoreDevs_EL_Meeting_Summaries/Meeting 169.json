    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 169",
    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nAt Meeting 169 of Ethereum Execution Layer core developers, several crucial topics were discussed and addressed. The primary focus was on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team deliberated over proposals for improving network scalability and security.\n\nOne notable discussion centered around EIP-4846 (Proto-Danksharding), which aims to increase block capacity by 128 times through a novel data structure called \"proto-dank sharding.\" The proposal has been updated, with version 2.0 incorporating feedback from the community. A consensus was reached on implementing this upgrade in Ethereum's upcoming Shanghai hardfork.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues and bugs**, several concerns were raised regarding gas pricing mechanisms and their impact on network congestion. To address these problems, a new EIP (EIP-4488) is being developed to introduce more granular gas price control. Additionally, the team discussed potential solutions for mitigating \"MEV\" (Maximal Extractable Value), which has been causing issues with transaction ordering.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** revealed that several clients are nearing completion of their implementation of EIP-4846. The Go Ethereum client is expected to be fully compliant by version 1.10, while the Parity client aims for a similar milestone in its next major release (v2.9). Testing has been ongoing, with some minor issues reported but overall progress deemed satisfactory.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** include finalizing EIP-4846 implementation across all clients before Shanghai's hardfork deployment. The team also agreed to schedule an additional meeting for reviewing the gas pricing mechanism proposal in preparation for its potential inclusion in a future upgrade."
