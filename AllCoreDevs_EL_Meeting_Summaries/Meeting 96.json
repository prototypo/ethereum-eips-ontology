    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 96",
    "Summary": "**Summary of All Core Devs Meeting 96**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) related to sharding, specifically EIP-4844 and its variants. The discussion centered around the need for more robust testing and validation of these proposals before implementation. It was agreed that further research is required to ensure seamless integration into the existing protocol.\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were also a key topic, with several clients reporting ongoing struggles with Byzantium's `CREATE2` opcode. The meeting highlighted the need for more comprehensive testing frameworks to identify and address these issues efficiently. Additionally, there was discussion around potential fixes for known vulnerabilities in certain client implementations.\n\nRegarding **development milestones and testing updates**, it was reported that the Go Ethereum (geth) team is making progress on implementing EIP-4844, with a target release date of April 2023. The Parity Ethereum client has also made significant strides in sharding development, aiming to integrate these features by mid-year.\n\n**Client implementation progress** showed varying levels of advancement across different clients. While some have made notable gains, others continue to face challenges related to EIP-4844 and `CREATE2`. It was emphasized that continued collaboration among developers is essential for achieving a unified client standard.\n\nLastly, **action items and upcoming deadlines** were outlined, including the need for more comprehensive testing of sharding proposals by the end of Q1 2023. The meeting concluded with an emphasis on maintaining open communication channels to ensure timely resolution of technical issues and successful implementation of future protocol upgrades."
