    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of this proposal in terms of scalability improvements.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported across various clients, including Geth and Parity. A notable issue was identified with **EIP-1559**, which caused a discrepancy between gas prices on mainnet and testnets due to differences in block reward calculations. The team proposed implementing the same logic for both environments to resolve this inconsistency.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, it was announced that the next major release of Geth (version 1.10) is scheduled for **Q2 <YEAR>**, with a focus on improving performance and reducing memory usage. Additionally, Parity's upcoming version (v2.7) will include enhancements to its caching mechanism.\n\nClient implementation progress showed steady advancements across various clients, including Besu and Nethermind. These implementations are crucial in ensuring the Ethereum protocol remains compatible with diverse use cases and environments.\n\nAction items assigned during this meeting included reviewing EIP-4848's impact on network congestion and implementing fixes for reported bugs by **<DATE>**. The team also discussed upcoming deadlines for client releases, emphasizing the importance of coordination to ensure a smooth transition between versions."
