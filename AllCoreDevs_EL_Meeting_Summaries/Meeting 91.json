    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nAt Meeting 91 of Ethereum Execution Layer core developers, several crucial topics were discussed and addressed. The primary focus was on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team deliberated over proposals for improving network scalability and security.\n\nOne key discussion centered around EIP-4846 (Proto-Danksharding), which aims to enhance sharding capabilities by introducing a new type of transaction, called \"proto-shards.\" The proposal has been updated to version 2.0, addressing concerns regarding gas costs and compatibility with existing shards. A consensus was reached on implementing the revised protocol in Ethereum's upcoming Berlin hardfork (version 12.1).\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, a critical bug affecting the execution of certain smart contracts under specific conditions was identified. The team collaborated to develop a patch that will be integrated into future client releases.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted progress on implementing EIP-1559 (London hardfork), which introduces a new fee market mechanism for transaction fees. Testing has shown promising results, with the next milestone being integration of this feature in Ethereum's upcoming London hardfork (version 12.2).\n\nLastly, **Client implementation progress** revealed that most clients are now aligned on implementing EIP-4846 and other proposed changes. The team also discussed action items for addressing outstanding issues and ensuring a smooth transition to future protocol upgrades.\n\nAction items were assigned with specific deadlines: the patch for the critical bug is expected by version 12.1, while implementation of EIP-1559 will be completed in time for London hardfork (version 12.2)."
