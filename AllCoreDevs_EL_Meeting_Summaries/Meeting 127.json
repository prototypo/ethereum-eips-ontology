    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 127",
    "Summary": "**Summary of All Core Devs Meeting 127**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which aims to increase the block gas limit by introducing a new data structure called \"proto-danksharding.\" The proposal has been met with both enthusiasm and skepticism among core developers. After thorough discussion, it was decided that further testing is required before making any decisions.\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were also extensively discussed during this meeting. A critical bug in the Ethereum 2.0 client implementation was identified and addressed by implementing a fix for the \"gas limit\" issue. Additionally, discussions centered around optimizing gas costs for certain operations to improve overall network efficiency.\n\nRegarding **development milestones and testing updates**, it's worth noting that the Goerli testnet is now live with version v1.10.4 of the Ethereum 2.0 client implementation. This milestone marks a significant step forward in preparing for mainnet deployment. Furthermore, discussions around implementing \"sharding\" on the execution layer are ongoing.\n\n**Client implementation progress**, specifically regarding the Prysm and Lighthouse clients, was also discussed during this meeting. Both implementations have made notable strides with version updates (Prysm v1.0.4 and Lighthouse v5.2) that address various technical issues and bugs identified in previous meetings.\n\nLastly, **action items and upcoming deadlines** were outlined for the next meeting. Key action items include finalizing EIP 4844 testing results and continuing discussions around sharding implementation on the execution layer."
