    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting 204 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting 204 focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4848 (Base Fee Upgrade). The proposal aims to improve the efficiency of transactions by introducing a new type of transaction that can be processed more quickly. After thorough discussion, it was decided to move forward with implementing this upgrade in Ethereum 2.0.\n\nTechnical issues and bugs were also discussed during the meeting. A critical bug affecting the Geth client's ability to process certain types of blocks was identified and assigned for resolution by a specific deadline (Ethereum 1.x release). Additionally, concerns regarding gas limit adjustments on testnets led to an agreement that these changes should be implemented in conjunction with upcoming protocol upgrades.\n\nDevelopment milestones were reviewed during the meeting. The Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1 deployment timeline was reaffirmed as Q3 this year, pending successful completion of testing and bug fixing for both Beacon Chain and Execution Layer components. Furthermore, progress on client implementation was reported: Prysmatic Labs' Lighthouse client has reached a milestone with its first testnet launch.\n\nAction items were assigned to several team members regarding EIP-4848's documentation, gas limit adjustments, and the Geth client bug resolution. The next meeting will focus on reviewing these updates as well as discussing further protocol upgrades (Ethereum 2.x)."
