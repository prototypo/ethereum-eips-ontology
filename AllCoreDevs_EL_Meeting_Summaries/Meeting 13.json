    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nAt Meeting 13 of Ethereum Core Developers, several crucial topics were discussed and addressed. The primary focus was on **Protocol Decisions and EIP Discussions**, where the team deliberated over proposals for improving network scalability and security. Notably, a consensus emerged to implement the \"Difficulty Bomb Delay\" (EIP-2383) to mitigate potential issues with block time variability.\n\n**Technical Issues and Proposed Solutions**\n\nSeveral technical concerns were raised during the meeting, including ongoing efforts to resolve **Geth's memory leak issue**, which has been affecting network performance. The team discussed possible solutions involving changes to Geth's garbage collection mechanism or implementing a new caching system. Additionally, discussions centered around addressing **EIP-1559**'s impact on gas prices and potential adjustments for improved user experience.\n\n**Development Milestones and Testing Updates**\n\nThe meeting highlighted several development milestones achieved since the previous gathering. Notably, the team has made significant progress in testing and implementing **Beacon Chain Phase 0**, with a focus on ensuring compatibility between different client implementations (e.g., Lighthouse, Prysm). The next phase of Beacon Chain development is expected to commence shortly.\n\n**Client Implementation Progress**\n\nSeveral clients have reported notable advancements since Meeting 12. For instance, the Lighthouse team has made substantial progress in implementing **Ethereum 2.0's consensus algorithm**, while Prysm and other implementations are working towards similar milestones. The meeting emphasized the importance of continued collaboration among client developers to ensure a smooth transition to Ethereum 2.0.\n\n**Action Items and Upcoming Deadlines**\n\nThe meeting concluded with several action items assigned to team members, including resolving Geth's memory leak issue by Meeting 14 and finalizing EIP-1559 adjustments for implementation in the next release cycle (expected Q3)."
