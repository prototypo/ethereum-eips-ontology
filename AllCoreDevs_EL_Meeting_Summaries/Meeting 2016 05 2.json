    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum Layer core developers discussed several critical topics during their recent gathering (MEETING_NUM). The primary focus was on **Protocol Decisions and EIP Discussions**, where they delved into various proposals, including the timing of future hardforks (Ethereum Improvement Proposals 10) and potential webassembly integration. Additionally, there were discussions around security audits (Issue 11), with a specific mention of upper bounds for block gas/transaction gas as per Issue 92.\n\n**Technical Issues and Proposed Solutions**\n\nThe meeting also touched upon technical issues, such as the concerns raised regarding EIP-5/Issue 8 due to its unbound return value leading to non-determinism. It was agreed that this issue should be formalized into a specific proposal for future discussion. Another notable point of discussion was ECADD, ECMUL, and MODEXP precompile additions (Ethereum Improvement Proposal), which are being considered.\n\n**Development Milestones and Testing Updates**\n\nThe developers also discussed the development milestones and testing updates. Specifically, they touched upon EIP-90's status regarding its inclusion in Metropolis, with a need for more formalization before any decisions can be made. Furthermore, there was an agreement to file Ethereum Improvement Proposals by creating issues on the GitHub repository.\n\n**Client Implementation Progress**\n\nThere were no specific client implementation progress updates mentioned during this meeting summary. However, it is worth noting that webassembly integration and potential hardforks are being considered for future development milestones.\n\n**Action Items and Upcoming Deadlines**\n\nThe developers agreed to formalize EIP-90's inclusion in Metropolis and create a new proposal for the concerns raised regarding EIP-5/Issue 8. Additionally, they will discuss these topics further during their next meeting."
