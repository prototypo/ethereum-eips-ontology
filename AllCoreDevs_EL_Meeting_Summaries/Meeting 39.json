    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 39",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of this proposal in reducing gas costs for users and improving scalability.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several clients reported encountering problems related to **Beacon Chain** synchronization with the Ethereum 1.x chain. Specifically, Geth developers noted an issue where their client was unable to properly sync due to a discrepancy between the two chains' block numbers. The team is working on implementing a fix for this problem.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, it appears that **Ethereum 2.0** (Serenity) remains on track for its scheduled release timeline. According to the meeting notes, the Beacon Chain has been successfully deployed in testnets with over 100 validators participating. This milestone marks a significant step towards achieving Ethereum's transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS).\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed during the meeting. Parity developers reported making good headway on implementing EIP-4848, while Besu and Nethermind clients are working on integrating with the Beacon Chain.\n\nAction items assigned include:\n\n* Implementing a fix for Geth's synchronization issue\n* Finalizing EIP-4848 implementation across all client implementations\n\nThe next meeting is scheduled to take place in two weeks' time."
