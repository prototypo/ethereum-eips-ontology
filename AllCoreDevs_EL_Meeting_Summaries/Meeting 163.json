    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 163",
    "Summary": "**Execution Layer Meeting 163 Summary**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4844**, also known as \"Proto-Danksharding.\" This proposal aims to improve the scalability of Ethereum by introducing a new type of transaction that can be processed more efficiently. The core developers engaged in an extensive discussion regarding its implementation details, including the potential impact on gas costs and network congestion.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported across various clients, with **Geth** experiencing difficulties related to memory management under high load conditions. Proposed solutions included adjustments to garbage collection settings and a temporary fix for affected nodes. Additionally, concerns about the stability of **Nethermind**, another prominent client implementation, led to discussions on potential improvements.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, it was announced that the next major release of Geth (version 1.10) is scheduled for mid-April. This update will include several bug fixes and performance enhancements. Meanwhile, Nethermind developers are working towards a new version with improved stability features.\n\nClient implementation progress showed varying degrees of advancement across different implementations. **Besu**, another notable client, reported significant strides in its development roadmap, including the completion of key components for EIP-4844 support. However, some clients still lagged behind due to resource constraints and ongoing maintenance tasks.\n\nAction items from this meeting include a review of Geth's memory management code by mid-March and an update on Nethermind's stability improvements within two weeks. The next Execution Layer Meeting is scheduled for late March, where the core developers will continue discussing EIP-4844 implementation details and addressing outstanding technical issues."
