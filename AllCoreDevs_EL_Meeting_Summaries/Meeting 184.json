    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary - Execution Layer Meeting 184**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4848, also known as \"Blob Storage.\" The core developers discussed the latest updates to this proposal, which aims to improve scalability by introducing a new type of transaction that can store large amounts of data off-chain. After reviewing various implementation details and testing results, it was decided to move forward with implementing EIP-4848 in Ethereum 2.0.\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were also discussed at length during the meeting. The team addressed a critical bug affecting the execution layer's ability to handle certain types of transactions efficiently. A patch has been developed and is currently undergoing testing before being merged into the main codebase. Additionally, there was an in-depth discussion on optimizing memory usage within the Execution Layer.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** were reviewed during the meeting. The team reported progress toward implementing EIP-4848, with a target completion date set for Ethereum 2.0's next major release (version 1.3). Testing has been ongoing to ensure seamless integration of this new feature into existing infrastructure.\n\nRegarding **Client implementation progress**, it was noted that most clients are on track to support the upcoming changes related to EIP-4848, with some minor variations in their implementation timelines. The team emphasized the importance of maintaining compatibility across different client implementations as they move forward with these updates.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** were also discussed during the meeting. Key tasks include finalizing testing for the patch addressing the critical bug mentioned earlier and completing EIP-4848's integration into Ethereum 2.0 by the next major release (version 1.3)."
