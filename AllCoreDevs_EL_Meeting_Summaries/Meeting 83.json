    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting Summary**\n\nAt Ethereum Execution Layer core developers' MEETING_NUM meeting, several crucial topics were discussed and addressed. The primary focus was on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team deliberated over proposed changes to improve network scalability and security.\n\nOne of the key takeaways from these discussions is the ongoing development of the \"Ethereum 2.0\" upgrade, which aims to transition Ethereum's consensus mechanism from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). The team discussed EIP-3675, a proposal for implementing sharding in Ethereum 2.0, and agreed on its implementation timeline.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, the meeting highlighted several ongoing efforts to resolve critical problems affecting client performance and security. Notably, the team addressed an issue with the \"sync\" process between clients, which has been causing delays for new node operators. A patch is being developed to fix this problem, expected to be released in version 1.10 of the Go Ethereum (geth) client.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** were also discussed during the meeting. The team reported progress on implementing the \"Bellatrix\" upgrade, a crucial step towards enabling sharding in Ethereum 2.0. Testing for this update is ongoing, with an expected completion date set for Q3 of [Year]. Additionally, the team reviewed plans to increase testing frequency and coverage.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** were outlined during the meeting, including:\n\n* Finalizing EIP-3675 implementation by end-Q2\n* Releasing patch 1.10 for geth client in mid-July\n* Completing Bellatrix upgrade testing by Q3\n\nThese developments demonstrate significant progress towards Ethereum's transition to a more scalable and secure consensus mechanism."
