    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes the introduction of a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" to improve scalability. The discussion centered around addressing concerns regarding gas costs, security implications, and potential interactions with existing protocols.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several clients reported progress in resolving outstanding problems. For instance, **Geth 1.10.8** has been released, which includes fixes for a critical vulnerability affecting the protocol's robustness. Additionally, discussions around implementing **EIP-1559**, aimed at improving gas price dynamics, continued with an emphasis on testing and validation.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates highlighted notable progress in client implementation. The **Beacon Chain Merge** milestone remains on track to be completed by Q2 2023, pending successful completion of the final stages of testing. Furthermore, several clients have made significant strides in implementing EIP-4848, with some reporting near-completion.\n\nAction items and upcoming deadlines were also discussed extensively during the meeting. Key takeaways include:\n\n* Finalizing EIP-1559 implementation across all major clients by Q1 2023\n* Completing testing for Beacon Chain Merge within the next two months\n* Resolving outstanding technical issues related to EIP-4848\n\nOverall, this meeting underscored the ongoing efforts of Ethereum core developers in addressing scalability concerns and improving protocol robustness."
