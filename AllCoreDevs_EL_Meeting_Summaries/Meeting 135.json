    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nAt Meeting #135 of Ethereum Layer 2 core developers, several crucial topics were discussed and addressed. The primary focus was on **Protocol Decisions and EIP Discussions**, where the team deliberated over proposals for improving scalability and security in the network.\n\nOne key discussion centered around **EIP-4844: Blob Storage** (version 1.0), which aims to enhance data storage efficiency by introducing a new type of transaction, called blobs. The proposal has garnered significant interest among developers due to its potential to reduce gas costs for users. After thorough review and debate, the team decided to move forward with implementing EIP-4844 in upcoming releases.\n\nRegarding **Technical Issues**, several bugs were reported across various clients (Geth 1.10.x, Parity 2.7.x). The most pressing concern was a synchronization issue affecting Geth's ability to connect to nodes running older versions of the protocol. A proposed solution involved updating the client's versioning system and implementing backward compatibility measures.\n\n**Development Milestones and Testing Updates**: As part of ongoing efforts to improve testing infrastructure, the team discussed integrating **Fuzz-Testing Frameworks**, such as Fuzzit (version 0.1), into their development pipeline. This will enable more comprehensive bug detection and prevention in future releases.\n\nLastly, several action items were assigned with specific deadlines:\n\n* Implement EIP-4844: Targeted for release in Q2\n* Integrate Fuzz-Testing Frameworks: Deadline set for end of March\n\nThese developments demonstrate the ongoing efforts to enhance Ethereum's scalability, security, and testing capabilities."
