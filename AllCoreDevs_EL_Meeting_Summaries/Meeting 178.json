    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary - Execution Layer Meeting 178 [2024-01-04]**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around **Protocol Decisions and EIP Discussions**, with a significant emphasis on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4846, which aims to increase the block gas limit. The core developers discussed potential issues related to network congestion and proposed modifications to mitigate these concerns.\n\n**Technical Issues, Bugs, and Proposed Solutions**\n\nA notable discussion centered around **Client Implementation Progress**, specifically regarding the integration of EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) upgrades in various client implementations. It was agreed that a unified approach would be beneficial for future development. Additionally, there were updates on ongoing efforts to resolve technical issues related to gas metering and transaction processing.\n\n**Development Milestones and Testing Updates**\n\nThe meeting highlighted several **Milestones and Deadlines**, including the upcoming release of Ethereum 2.0's Execution Layer (also known as \"Surge\"). The core developers discussed testing plans, focusing on ensuring a smooth transition from the current protocol to the new one. A key takeaway was that all client implementations must be compatible with EIP-4846 by **February 2024**.\n\n**Action Items and Upcoming Deadlines**\n\nThe meeting concluded with several action items assigned to specific core developers, including reviewing proposed modifications for EIP-4846 and finalizing testing plans for the Surge release. The next Execution Layer Meeting is scheduled for January 18th, where these updates will be revisited and further discussed.\n\nOverall, this meeting demonstrated a collaborative effort among Ethereum's core development team in addressing pressing technical concerns while pushing forward with key protocol upgrades."
