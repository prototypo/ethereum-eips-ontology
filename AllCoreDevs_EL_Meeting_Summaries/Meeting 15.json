The primary focus was on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team deliberated over proposed changes to improve network scalability and security. Notably, a consensus emerged around implementing the \"Difficulty Bomb Delay\" (EIP-2383), which will be activated in Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1. This change aims to mitigate potential issues arising from the difficulty bomb mechanism.\n\n**Technical Issues**\n\nRegarding **technical issues**, bugs, and proposed solutions, several key points were raised. The team discussed a critical vulnerability discovered in the `geth` client (version 1.10.x), which could lead to unauthorized access if exploited. A patch has been developed and is being reviewed for inclusion in future releases.\n\n**Development Milestones**\n\nThe meeting also covered **development milestones and testing updates**, with an emphasis on Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1 deployment timeline. The team confirmed that the testnet will be launched by mid-April, followed by a mainnet launch target of Q3 this year. Additionally, progress was reported on implementing the Beacon Chain (version 1.4), which is expected to improve network security and efficiency.\n\n**Client Implementation Progress**\n\nRegarding **client implementation**, `geth` version 1.10.x has been updated with several bug fixes and performance enhancements. The team also discussed ongoing work on integrating Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1 features into the client, including support for the Beacon Chain.\n\n**Action Items and Upcoming Deadlines**\n\nThe meeting concluded with a review of **action items and upcoming deadlines**, emphasizing the need to finalize EIP-2383 implementation details by April 15th.
