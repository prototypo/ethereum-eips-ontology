    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes the introduction of \"blobs\" to improve scalability. The discussion centered around addressing concerns regarding gas costs and potential security implications.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported in various clients, including Geth (version 1.10.6) and Parity (version 2.7.0). A proposed solution for the Geth bug involved a minor code update to address an issue with transaction processing. Additionally, there was discussion around implementing **EIP-1559**, which aims to improve gas pricing mechanisms.\n\nDevelopment milestones were also discussed, with attention given to testing updates and client implementation progress. The team is working towards releasing Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1 (Capella) in the near future, targeting a Q3 release timeline for mainnet deployment. This phase will introduce proof-of-stake consensus and sharding capabilities.\n\nClient implementation progress was reported as ongoing, with various teams contributing to different aspects of the project. Notably, **Geth** is currently at version 1.10.x, while **Parity** has reached version 2.7.x. The team emphasized the importance of continued testing and collaboration among clients to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nAction items were assigned for several tasks, including reviewing EIP-4848's security implications and finalizing the Capella release timeline. Upcoming deadlines include completing Phase 1 development by Q3 and conducting thorough testing before mainnet deployment."
