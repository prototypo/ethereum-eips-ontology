    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes the introduction of \"blobs\" to improve scalability. The discussion centered around addressing concerns regarding gas costs and potential security implications.\n\nRegarding technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions, the team addressed several pressing matters. Notably, they discussed the ongoing efforts to resolve a critical issue with **Ethereum 2.0's** (Beacon Chain) **deposit contract**, which has been causing delays in the transition process. The developers acknowledged that further testing is required before implementing any fixes.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, the team reported progress on several fronts. They announced plans to conduct a comprehensive testnet for Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1 (Capella) by **Q3 <YEAR>**, with a focus on ensuring seamless integration between Beacon Chain and Execution Layer clients. Additionally, they highlighted ongoing work towards implementing **Ethereum Improvement Proposal-1559** (tip pooling), which aims to reduce gas costs for users.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed during the meeting. The team reported that most major clients are now compatible with Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1, although some minor issues persist. Notably, Lighthouse and Nimbus have made significant strides in implementing Beacon Chain functionality.\n\nAction items and upcoming deadlines were outlined at the conclusion of the meeting. Key takeaways include:\n\n* Finalizing EIP-4848 by **Q3 <YEAR>**\n* Resolving deposit contract issue within two weeks\n* Conducting comprehensive testnet for Phase 1 (Capella) in Q3 <YEAR>\n\nThese developments underscore the ongoing efforts to improve Ethereum's scalability, security, and usability."
