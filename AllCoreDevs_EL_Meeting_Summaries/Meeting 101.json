    "Summary": "**Summary of MEETING_NUM All Core Devs Meeting**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which aims to increase the block gas limit by introducing a new data structure called \"proto-danksharding.\" The proposal has been met with both enthusiasm and skepticism among core developers. After an in-depth discussion, it was decided that EIP-4844 will be implemented as part of Ethereum's upcoming Shanghai upgrade (version 1.2).\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were also a key topic for the meeting. The team discussed several critical bug fixes related to gas metering and transaction processing. Notably, a fix was agreed upon for an issue affecting the \"gas left\" calculation in certain scenarios.\n\nRegarding **development milestones and testing updates**, it was reported that the Ethereum 2.0 testnet (version 1.3) is nearing completion with several key features implemented or partially completed. The team also discussed plans to increase the frequency of testnet releases, aiming for a more agile development process.\n\n**Client implementation progress** showed significant advancements across various clients, including Prysm and Lighthouse. These implementations are crucial for Ethereum's transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). The meeting highlighted ongoing efforts by the client teams to address technical debt and ensure compatibility with upcoming protocol upgrades.\n\nLastly, **action items and upcoming deadlines** were outlined, including a call for community feedback on EIP-4844 within two weeks. Core developers also agreed upon an accelerated timeline for implementing several critical bug fixes before the Shanghai upgrade release (targeted for Q2 2023)."
