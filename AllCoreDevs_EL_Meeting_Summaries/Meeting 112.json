    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 112",
    "Summary": "**All Core Devs Meeting 112 Summary**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around EIP discussions and protocol decisions, with a significant emphasis on **Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844**, which aims to increase the block gas limit by introducing a new data structure. The proposal has garnered substantial interest among developers, with several key stakeholders weighing in on its potential impact.\n\nRegarding technical issues, the team discussed ongoing efforts to resolve the \"difficulty bomb\" issue, which is expected to occur around **Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1** (Berlin). This problem arises from a gradual increase in mining difficulty over time and could potentially lead to network instability if left unaddressed.\n\nIn terms of development milestones, the team reported progress on implementing EIP-4844 across various client implementations, including Geth and Besu. The implementation is expected to be completed by **Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1 (Berlin)** release, which is currently slated for Q3 this year.\n\nClient implementation updates revealed that several clients are nearing completion of the necessary changes required for EIP-4844 integration. Notably, Geth has made significant strides in implementing the new data structure and is expected to be fully compliant by **Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1 (Berlin)** release.\n\nAction items assigned during this meeting include:\n\n* Finalizing EIP-4844 implementation across all client implementations\n* Resolving outstanding technical issues related to difficulty bomb mitigation\n\nThe next All Core Devs Meeting is scheduled for [insert date]."
