    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 86",
    "Summary": "**Summary of All Core Devs Meeting 86**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which aims to increase the block gas limit by introducing a new type of transaction called \"Proto-Danksharding\". The discussion centered around potential issues related to network congestion and scalability. After thorough debate, it was decided that further testing is required before making any changes.\n\n**Technical Issues and Proposed Solutions**\n\nSeveral technical concerns were raised during the meeting, including an issue with the `GETH` client's handling of uncle headers in Byzantium blocks (EIP 210). A proposed solution to this problem involves updating the `GETH` codebase. Additionally, a bug was reported affecting some nodes' ability to process transactions correctly.\n\n**Development Milestones and Testing Updates**\n\nThe meeting highlighted several development milestones, including progress on implementing EIP-4844 in various clients (e.g., Besu 21.1.0). The testing team also provided an update on the ongoing \"Berlin\" testnet deployment, which is expected to be completed by mid-March.\n\n**Client Implementation Progress**\n\nSeveral client implementations are making significant strides towards integrating new features and bug fixes. For instance, `GETH` has released version 1.10.4 with various improvements related to gas pricing and transaction processing efficiency.\n\n**Action Items and Upcoming Deadlines**\n\nKey action items from the meeting include:\n\n* Finalizing EIP-4844 testing by end of March\n* Resolving uncle header issue in Byzantium blocks (EIP 210) within two weeks\n* Completing Berlin testnet deployment by mid-March"
