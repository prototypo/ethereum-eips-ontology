    "Summary": "**All Core Devs Meeting 136 Summary**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) discussions and protocol decisions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of increased scalability and gas savings for users.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported in various clients, including Geth (version 1.10.11) and Parity (version 2.7.0-beta). A proposed solution to address these issues was presented by a core developer, which involves updating the affected codebase with patches from an external contributor.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, it was announced that **Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1** is nearing completion, with a planned launch date set for Q3 this year (2024). The team has been working diligently to resolve outstanding issues related to the Beacon Chain's integration with the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nClient implementation progress showed notable advancements in Parity and Besu clients, both of which are now compatible with EIP-4848. However, Geth still requires further updates before it can support this new transaction type.\n\nAction items assigned during the meeting include:\n\n* Finalizing EIP-4848 for inclusion in Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1\n* Resolving outstanding bugs and implementing patches across various clients\n* Conducting thorough testing of Beacon Chain integration with mainnet\n\nThe next All Core Devs Meeting is scheduled to take place within two weeks, where the team will continue discussing these developments and addressing any emerging concerns."
