    "Summary": "**All Core Devs Meeting 145 Summary**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently than traditional transactions. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of increased scalability and reduced gas costs.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported in various clients, including Geth (version 1.10.11) and Besu (version 21.2.0). A proposed solution for one such bug involved updating the `gas_limit` calculation to prevent overflows. Additionally, there was a discussion on implementing **EIP-3675**, which introduces a new mechanism for handling chain reorganizations.\n\nDevelopment milestones were also discussed, with an update provided on the status of Ethereum 2.0's Beacon Chain (version 1.4). The team reported progress toward resolving outstanding issues and improving overall performance. Testing updates included reports from various clients, such as Prysm (version 3.5) and Lighthouse (version 6.0), which highlighted areas for improvement.\n\nClient implementation progress was also a key topic of discussion. Several teams shared their plans to implement upcoming EIPs, including **EIP-1559**, which introduces a new fee market mechanism. Action items assigned during the meeting included reviewing proposed solutions for reported bugs and finalizing timelines for implementing pending EIPs.\n\nNotable deadlines mentioned in this meeting include an expected release of Ethereum 2.0's Beacon Chain within Q3 2024, contingent on resolving outstanding technical issues. Overall, the discussion centered around refining protocol decisions to ensure a smooth transition toward increased scalability and improved performance."
