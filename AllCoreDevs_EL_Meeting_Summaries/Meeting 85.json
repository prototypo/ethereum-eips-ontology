    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 85",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently than traditional transactions. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of this proposal, including improved scalability and reduced gas costs.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several clients reported encountering problems with **Berkeley DB** (BDB) upgrades on Linux systems due to a known issue affecting certain versions of BDB. A proposed solution involves downgrading or upgrading specific packages to resolve these compatibility concerns. Additionally, the team discussed ongoing efforts to address memory leaks in some client implementations.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates highlighted progress toward implementing **EIP-1559**, which introduces a new fee market mechanism for Ethereum transactions. The implementation is expected to be completed by Q2 2023 (version v1.13). Testing has also begun on the upcoming **Merge** upgrade, with several clients participating in testnets.\n\nClient implementation progress showed that most major clients are making steady strides toward implementing EIP-4848 and other proposed upgrades. Notably, Geth is ahead of schedule for its v1.12 release, which will include support for EIP-1559.\n\nAction items assigned during the meeting included:\n\n* Resolving BDB upgrade issues on Linux systems\n* Finalizing implementation details for EIP-4848\n* Continuing testing and validation efforts for upcoming upgrades\n\nThe next meeting is scheduled to take place in two weeks' time, with a focus on reviewing progress toward these action items."
