    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 99",
    "Summary": "**Summary of All Core Devs Meeting 99**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4848, also known as \"Proto-Danksharding.\" The core devs discussed the latest implementation details and addressed concerns regarding its impact on network performance. A key takeaway is that the current implementation will require an increase in gas prices to accommodate the new protocol changes.\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were another crucial topic of discussion. Notably, a bug was identified in the `geth` client's handling of RLPx connections, which could lead to connection drops under certain circumstances. A patch has been submitted for review, with an aim to resolve this issue before the upcoming Berlin hardfork.\n\nIn terms of **development milestones and testing updates**, it appears that progress is being made towards implementing EIP-1559 in conjunction with the London hardfork (expected release: June 2021). The core devs also discussed ongoing efforts to improve test coverage, including the development of new tools for automated testing. Notably, a recent spike in test failures has prompted concerns regarding potential regressions.\n\n**Client implementation progress** was reported as steady across various clients, with notable updates from `geth` and `parity`. However, some issues were raised regarding compatibility between different client implementations, which will require further investigation to resolve.\n\nLastly, the meeting concluded with a review of **action items and upcoming deadlines**, including an update on the status of EIP-1559 implementation across various clients. The core devs also discussed plans for future meetings and working groups focused on specific topics such as testing infrastructure and client compatibility."
