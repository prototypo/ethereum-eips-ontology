    "Summary": "**Summary of All Core Devs Meeting 120**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4848, also known as \"Proto-Danksharding\". The proposal aims to improve the scalability of Ethereum by introducing a new type of transaction that can be processed more efficiently. After thorough discussion, it was decided to move forward with implementing this feature in the upcoming Berlin hardfork (Ethereum 1.x version: v0.9.2). This decision is expected to significantly enhance the network's capacity and reduce congestion.\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were also discussed at length during the meeting. A critical bug affecting the execution of certain smart contracts was identified in the current implementation (Ethereum 1.x version: v0.9.1). The team worked together to propose a fix for this issue, which is expected to be implemented shortly.\n\nIn terms of **development milestones and testing updates**, it was reported that the development of Ethereum 2.0's Beacon Chain has made significant progress (version: v0.8.3). Testing efforts are ongoing, with an emphasis on ensuring seamless integration between the Beacon Chain and the Execution Layer.\n\n**Client implementation progress** showed notable advancements across various clients, including Geth (v1.10.4) and Parity (v2.7.5-beta). The team is working diligently to ensure that all implementations align with the agreed-upon protocol changes.\n\nLastly, **action items and upcoming deadlines** were outlined for the next meeting. Key tasks include finalizing EIP-4848 implementation details, resolving outstanding technical issues, and continuing testing efforts on both Beacon Chain and Execution Layer components."
