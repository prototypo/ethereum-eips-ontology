    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 130",
    "Summary": "**All Core Devs Meeting 130 Summary**\n\nThe most impactful development from this meeting is the ongoing discussion around EIP-4846, a proposed upgrade that aims to improve Ethereum's scalability by introducing a new type of transaction called \"blobs\". The proposal has been met with both enthusiasm and skepticism among core developers. After thorough discussions, it was decided to move forward with implementing EIP-4846 in conjunction with the upcoming Shanghai hardfork (Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1). This decision is expected to significantly improve Ethereum's scalability.\n\nRegarding technical issues, a critical bug affecting the Beacon Chain's proposer selection process was identified and addressed by the developers. The issue arose due to an incorrect implementation of the proposer selection algorithm in some clients. A patch has been proposed and will be implemented before the Shanghai hardfork. Additionally, discussions around improving the Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1 testnets' stability and usability were held.\n\nIn terms of development milestones, it was announced that the Goerli testnet (Ethereum 2.0 Phase 0) is now fully functional with a stable Beacon Chain implementation. This marks an important milestone in preparing for the upcoming Shanghai hardfork. The client implementations are also progressing steadily, with most clients having implemented EIP-4846 and other necessary upgrades.\n\nAction items from this meeting include finalizing the patch for the proposer selection bug before the Shanghai hardfork and ensuring that all clients implement EIP-4846 correctly. Upcoming deadlines were discussed, including a review of client implementations by February 15th to ensure readiness for the Shanghai hardfork in March."
