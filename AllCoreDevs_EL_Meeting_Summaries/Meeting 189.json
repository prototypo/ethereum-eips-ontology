    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary - Execution Layer Meeting 189 [2024-06-06]**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around **Protocol Decisions and EIP Discussions**, with a significant emphasis on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4846, which aims to increase the block gas limit. The core developers deliberated extensively on the proposal's implications for network scalability and security.\n\nRegarding **Technical Issues, Bugs, and Proposed Solutions**, several concerns were raised regarding the recent implementation of EVM (Execution Environment Virtual Machine) upgrades in various client implementations. Specifically, issues with opcode handling and memory management were discussed at length. The team proposed a patch to address these problems, which is expected to be implemented across all clients by **Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1**.\n\nIn terms of **Development Milestones and Testing Updates**, the meeting highlighted progress toward integrating EIP-4846 into mainnet. A testnet deployment was scheduled for **June 15th**, with a subsequent review of its performance to inform final preparations for mainnet integration by **July 10th**.\n\nThe discussion on **Client Implementation Progress** revealed that most clients are now aligned in their implementation plans, although some minor discrepancies remain regarding the handling of certain opcodes. The team acknowledged these differences and agreed to maintain open communication channels to ensure a unified approach moving forward.\n\nLastly, several action items were assigned with specific deadlines:\n\n* Review EIP-4846 patch by **June 20th**\n* Finalize mainnet integration plan for EIP-4846 by **July 1st**\n\nThese developments underscore the ongoing efforts of Ethereum core developers toward enhancing network scalability and security."
