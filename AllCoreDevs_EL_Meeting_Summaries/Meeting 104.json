    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 104",
    "Summary": "**Summary of All Core Devs Meeting 104**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4848, also known as \"Proto-Danksharding.\" The proposal aims to improve the scalability of Ethereum by introducing a new type of transaction that can be processed more efficiently. After thorough discussion, it was decided to move forward with implementing EIP-4848 in the upcoming Berlin hardfork (version 12.1). This decision is expected to significantly enhance the network's capacity and reduce congestion.\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were also a key topic of discussion. The team identified several critical bugs that need immediate attention, including an issue with gas metering for EVM opcodes in version 11.x clients. A patch has been submitted to address this problem, which is expected to be merged soon.\n\nIn terms of **development milestones and testing updates**, the meeting highlighted progress on implementing various features, such as improved transaction processing and enhanced debugging tools. The team also discussed ongoing efforts to improve test coverage for Ethereum's execution layer.\n\n**Client implementation progress** was another area of focus, with a particular emphasis on updating popular clients like Geth (version 1.10.x) and Parity (version 2.7.x). These updates are expected to be released in the coming weeks, bringing various bug fixes and performance improvements.\n\nFinally, **action items and upcoming deadlines** were discussed, including a review of EIP-1559's implementation status for version 12.1. The team agreed on several key milestones and timelines, ensuring that all necessary steps will be taken to meet these objectives."
