    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 190",
    "Summary": "**Execution Layer Meeting 190 Summary**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around Protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4844**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for execution layer transactions. The core developers engaged in an extensive discussion regarding the potential benefits and drawbacks of implementing this feature, including its impact on scalability and gas costs.\n\nRegarding technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions, several clients reported encountering difficulties with the recent **Berlin hardfork** (Ethereum Protocol Version 12). Specifically, Parity client users experienced a bug that caused their nodes to become stuck in an infinite loop. The developers worked together to identify the root cause of this issue and implemented patches for affected versions.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, several clients reported progress on implementing **Execution Layer (EL) support**. For instance, Geth client version 1.10.9 has been released with EL functionality enabled by default. Additionally, a new testnet was launched to facilitate further testing and validation of the Execution Layer.\n\nClient implementation progress showed that most major clients are now actively working on implementing EIP-4844. Notably, Parity's EL support is expected to be fully integrated in their upcoming version 2.7 release. Action items assigned during this meeting include finalizing a timeline for EIP-4844 deployment and conducting thorough testing of the Execution Layer.\n\nOverall, this meeting highlighted significant progress toward implementing data availability sampling on Ethereum's execution layer. The core developers demonstrated collaboration and dedication to resolving technical issues while pushing forward with key development milestones."
