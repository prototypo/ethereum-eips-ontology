    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting 152 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting #152 focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4848 (Base Fee Upgrade). The proposal aims to improve the efficiency of transactions by introducing a new type of transaction that includes data. After thorough discussion, it was decided to move forward with implementing this upgrade in Ethereum 2.0.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported and proposed solutions discussed. Notably, an issue affecting gas metering for certain types of operations was identified and addressed through code changes. Additionally, the team reviewed a patch for a previously discovered vulnerability related to transaction ordering.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates highlighted progress on Ethereum 2.0's Beacon Chain implementation. The current version is v1.10.5, with plans to release v1.11 soon. Testing has been ongoing, focusing on stress-testing the network under various scenarios. Notably, a recent test revealed an issue affecting shard data availability; developers are working to resolve this.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed, particularly for Lighthouse and Teku clients. Both have made significant strides in implementing Ethereum 2.0 features. However, some concerns were raised regarding compatibility between the two clients' implementations of EIP-4848.\n\nAction items assigned during the meeting include finalizing the Base Fee Upgrade proposal (EIP-4848) by [Deadline] and addressing outstanding issues with shard data availability. The next meeting will focus on reviewing progress made since this one, as well as discussing further protocol decisions and technical developments."
