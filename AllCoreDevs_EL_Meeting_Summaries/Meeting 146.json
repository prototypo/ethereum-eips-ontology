    "Summary": "**All Core Devs Meeting 146 Summary**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around EIP discussions and protocol decisions, with a significant emphasis on **Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844**, which aims to increase the block gas limit by introducing a new data structure. The proposal has garnered substantial interest among developers, with some expressing concerns about its potential impact on network congestion.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported and discussed during the meeting. Notably, **Beacon Chain's (BC) version 1.2** introduced an issue that caused nodes to become stuck in a loop when processing certain types of blocks. The developers proposed a fix for this bug, which is expected to be implemented soon.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, the meeting highlighted progress on implementing **EIP-4844** across various clients (e.g., Geth 1.10.x). Additionally, there was discussion around updating the Beacon Chain's versioning system to better reflect its current state.\n\nClient implementation progress showed that most major clients are making good headway in integrating EIP-4844 and other recent changes. However, some concerns were raised about potential compatibility issues between different client versions.\n\nAction items from this meeting include:\n\n* Finalizing a fix for the Beacon Chain's version 1.2 bug\n* Implementing EIP-4844 across all major clients by **Q3 2023**\n* Review and discussion of upcoming changes to the Ethereum protocol\n\nOverall, while some concerns were raised during the meeting, progress on implementing key upgrades like EIP-4844 remains a top priority for the development team."
