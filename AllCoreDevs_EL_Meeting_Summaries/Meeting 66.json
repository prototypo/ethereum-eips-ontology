    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 66",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of this proposal in reducing gas costs for users and improving scalability.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several clients reported encountering problems related to **Beacon Chain synchronization** with the Ethereum 1.x chain. Proposed solutions included adjusting parameters such as `MAX_COMMITTEE_SIZE` or implementing additional checks during sync processes. The developers also discussed a potential fix for an issue affecting gas metering in certain scenarios.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, several clients reported progress on **Ethereum 2.0** implementation, with notable advancements from Prysm (version `v1.3`) and Lighthouse (`v5.4`). The meeting also touched upon the upcoming **Berlin hardfork**, scheduled for April <DATE>, which will introduce EIP-2567 to improve gas efficiency.\n\nClient implementation progress was another key area of discussion, with several clients reporting on their current status regarding Ethereum 2.x compatibility. Notably, Nethermind (`v0.16`) and Teku (version `1.3`) are nearing completion of the necessary changes for full support.\n\nAction items assigned during the meeting include reviewing EIP-4848's implementation details by **March <DATE>** to ensure a smooth integration into upcoming hardforks. Additionally, clients were tasked with providing updates on their progress toward Ethereum 2.x compatibility and addressing ongoing technical issues related to Beacon Chain synchronization."
