    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 79",
    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nIn Meeting #<MEETING_NUM> of Ethereum <LAYER_TYPE> Layer core developers, several crucial topics were discussed and addressed. The primary focus was on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team deliberated over proposed changes to improve network scalability and security.\n\nOne key discussion centered around EIP-1559, a protocol upgrade aimed at reducing congestion by introducing a base fee for transactions. After thorough review, it was decided that this proposal would be implemented in conjunction with other upgrades, including EIP-3233, which introduces an improved gas pricing mechanism. The team also discussed the importance of implementing these changes to mitigate potential attacks on the network.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues and bugs**, several concerns were raised regarding client implementation progress. Specifically, it was noted that some clients are experiencing difficulties in correctly processing certain types of transactions due to a bug introduced by EIP-1559's predecessor (EIP-1484). The team agreed upon an urgent fix for this issue.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** revealed significant progress on the upcoming Berlin hardfork. With only 1 hour and 25 minutes remaining until the scheduled deployment, developers are working diligently to ensure a smooth transition. Key metrics indicate that over 90% of nodes have been upgraded with the necessary patches.\n\nLastly, **Action items and upcoming deadlines** were outlined for each team member involved in implementing these changes. Notably, all clients must be updated by January 24th at 14:00 UTC (the meeting's scheduled end time) to ensure a seamless transition during the Berlin hardfork deployment on February 2nd.\n\nThe next meeting will focus on reviewing client implementation progress and addressing any remaining concerns before the upcoming hardfork."
