    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 9",
    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary - All Core Devs Meeting 9**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which aims to increase the block gas limit by introducing a new data structure. The discussion centered around its implementation timeline, with a proposed activation date set for Shanghai (Shapella), currently scheduled for April 2023.\n\n**Technical issues and bugs were also discussed**, including an ongoing investigation into a potential issue affecting the execution of certain smart contracts on the Ethereum mainnet. A proposed solution was presented by one developer, which involves modifying the contract's bytecode to mitigate the problem. The team agreed to further review this proposal before implementing any changes.\n\nIn terms of **development milestones and testing updates**, it was reported that several clients are nearing completion of their Shanghai upgrades. Go-ethereum (geth) is currently at version 1.10.15, while Nethermind has reached v0.17.3-alpha. The team also discussed the upcoming testnet merge, with a focus on ensuring seamless integration between execution and consensus layers.\n\n**Client implementation progress was another key topic**, as several clients are working towards implementing EIP-4844 in preparation for Shanghai's activation. Notably, Prysmatic Labs' client has made significant strides in this regard, with their version 2.3.0-alpha release featuring initial support for the new data structure.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines were also discussed**, including a reminder to finalize the EIP-4844 implementation timeline by the end of March. The team agreed to reconvene before Shanghai's activation date to review progress, address any outstanding issues, and ensure a smooth transition to the upgraded protocol."
