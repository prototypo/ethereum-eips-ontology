    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nAt Meeting #<MEETING_NUM> of Ethereum <LAYER_TYPE> Layer core developers, several crucial topics were discussed and addressed. The primary focus was on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team deliberated over proposed changes to improve network scalability and security.\n\nOne key discussion centered around EIP-999 (ERC-20 Token Standard), which aims to enhance token functionality and usability. After thorough review, it was decided that a revised version of the proposal would be submitted for further consideration. Additionally, the group discussed potential solutions to mitigate the impact of 51% attacks on the network.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, several critical concerns were raised regarding client implementation progress. Specifically, Parity's team reported ongoing efforts to resolve a long-standing issue with their light-client protocol. Meanwhile, Geth developers acknowledged that they are working towards addressing performance bottlenecks in their codebase.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** revealed notable advancements across various clients. For instance, the latest version of Besu (3.13) boasts improved stability and security features. Furthermore, a comprehensive test suite for Ethereum 2.0's Beacon Chain has been developed to ensure seamless integration with existing infrastructure.\n\nLastly, **Action items and upcoming deadlines** were outlined to guide future development efforts. Notably, all clients are expected to implement the revised EIP-999 by Q1 <YEAR>. Moreover, regular security audits will be conducted for each client implementation to guarantee network resilience against potential threats."
