    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of this proposal, including improved scalability and reduced gas costs.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several clients reported encountering problems related to **Beacon Chain** integration with Ethereum 1.x chains. Specifically, Geth developers noted a bug in their implementation of the Beacon Chain's `attestations` API, which was causing inconsistencies when processing attestations from validators. The team is working on resolving this issue and expects it to be fixed by version **Geth v1.10**.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, several clients reported progress towards implementing Ethereum 2.x features in their codebases. For instance, Parity developers announced that they have successfully integrated the Beacon Chain with their client's `sharding` module, paving the way for further sharding-related developments. Additionally, Nethermind developers shared an update on their testing framework, which now supports **EVM-256** and is expected to be completed by version **Nethermind v1.2**.\n\nAction items assigned during this meeting include reviewing EIP-4848's implementation details and providing feedback within the next two weeks. The team also agreed to schedule a follow-up discussion on Beacon Chain integration issues, with specific goals for resolving these problems outlined in the meeting notes."
