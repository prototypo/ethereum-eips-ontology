    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 36",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes the introduction of data availability sampling for improved scalability. The discussion centered around addressing concerns regarding gas costs and potential security implications.\n\nRegarding technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions, the team addressed several critical matters. Notably, they discussed an issue affecting Ethereum 2.0's beacon chain, where a bug in the implementation was causing inconsistencies with block production times. A fix has been implemented for **Ethereum 1.x** clients to mitigate this problem.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates highlighted progress toward implementing EIP-4848 on mainnet by Q3 of <YEAR>. The team also discussed ongoing work related to Ethereum's upcoming hard fork, **The Merge**, which is expected in September. This update will integrate the beacon chain with the current execution layer, significantly enhancing network efficiency.\n\nClient implementation progress showed that most major clients (e.g., Geth and Nethermind) are on track for implementing EIP-4848 by Q3 of <YEAR>. However, some concerns were raised regarding potential compatibility issues between different client versions. The team emphasized the importance of thorough testing to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nAction items assigned during this meeting include finalizing the implementation details for EIP-4848 and conducting extensive testing before its deployment on mainnet. Key deadlines mentioned included completing these tasks by Q3, with specific milestones set for each phase of development."
