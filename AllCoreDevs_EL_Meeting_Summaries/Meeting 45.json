    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 45",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes the introduction of a new data structure called \"blobs\" to improve scalability. The discussion centered around addressing concerns regarding gas costs, security implications, and potential interactions with existing protocols.\n\nIn terms of technical issues and bugs, several clients reported encountering problems related to **Beacon Chain** synchronization and **Shard Data Propagation**, which are critical components for the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Proposed solutions included adjustments to beacon chain parameters and enhancements to shard data propagation mechanisms. The meeting also touched on ongoing efforts to resolve a long-standing issue with **gas limit calculations** in certain scenarios.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates highlighted progress toward implementing key features, such as **Sharding**, which is expected to significantly enhance the network's scalability. Testing has been conducted using various tools, including **Geth** and **Nethermind**, with encouraging results reported for both clients' implementations of sharded data propagation mechanisms.\n\nClient implementation progress showed that most major clients are on track to meet their respective development milestones, although some minor delays were noted due to ongoing testing and refinement. Action items assigned during the meeting included further review of EIP-4848's security implications and continued optimization efforts for beacon chain synchronization algorithms.\n\nThe next meeting is scheduled in two weeks' time, with a focus on finalizing key protocol decisions ahead of Ethereum 2.0's expected launch timeline."
