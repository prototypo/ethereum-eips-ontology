    "Summary": "**All Core Devs Meeting 128 Summary**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around EIP discussions and protocol decisions, with a significant emphasis on **Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844**, which proposes to increase the block gas limit by introducing a new data structure. The discussion centered around its potential impact on scalability and security concerns.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported in various clients, including Geth and Parity. A proposed solution for one of these bugs involved updating the `keccak256` function implementation. Additionally, there was an ongoing debate about the **EIP 1559** gas fee market mechanism's effectiveness in reducing congestion on the network.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates were also discussed during this meeting. The team is working towards implementing EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) version 1.2, which includes several performance improvements and bug fixes. A testnet for **Berlin Hardfork**, scheduled to occur around April-May timeframe, was announced with a focus on stress-testing the new features.\n\nClient implementation progress showed that most clients are making good headway in implementing EIP-4844's proposed changes. However, there were some concerns raised about potential compatibility issues between different client implementations of this feature.\n\nAction items and upcoming deadlines included finalizing the **EVM 1.2** specification by March 15th and conducting a thorough review of all clients' implementation progress before the Berlin Hardfork testnet launch in April-May timeframe."
