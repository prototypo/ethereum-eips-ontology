    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 186",
    "Summary": "**Execution Layer Meeting 186 Summary**\n\nThe core discussion at Execution Layer Meeting 186 centered around Protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4844**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for Ethereum's execution layer. The proposal aims to improve scalability by reducing the amount of data that needs to be stored on-chain. After thorough review and discussion, the core developers decided to move forward with implementing this EIP.\n\nRegarding technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions, a notable topic was **the ongoing investigation into the \"difficulty bomb\" issue**. This problem arises from the gradual increase in block difficulty over time, which can lead to network congestion and decreased security. The team is working on identifying potential causes and developing strategies for mitigation or removal.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates revealed that several clients are making progress towards implementing **EIP-4844**, with some already having merged patches into their codebases. Notably, the Geth client has reached a milestone of 80% completion in its implementation. The team also discussed upcoming deadlines for EVM (Execution Environment) upgrades.\n\nClient implementation progress was another key focus area, with discussions centered around **Geth's and Besu's** respective implementations of EIP-4844. Both clients are making steady progress towards full compliance with the proposed standard. Action items assigned during this meeting include finalizing a timeline for implementing EVM upgrades across all client implementations.\n\nOverall, Execution Layer Meeting 186 highlighted significant advancements in protocol development, particularly regarding scalability and security enhancements through EIP-4844 implementation."
