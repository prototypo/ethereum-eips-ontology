    "Summary": "**Execution Layer Meeting 202**\n\nThe recent Execution Layer core developer meeting focused on several critical topics that will shape the future of Ethereum's execution layer. **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions** took center stage, with a primary emphasis on finalizing the implementation details for EIP-4844 (Base Fee) and its interaction with other upcoming proposals like EIP-5593 (Gas Cost Model). The team agreed to implement Base Fee in conjunction with the London hardfork, scheduled for June 2022.\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were also extensively discussed. A critical bug affecting gas metering was identified and a fix is being worked on by the developers. Additionally, concerns regarding the interaction between EIP-4844 and existing clients led to an agreement to conduct thorough testing before deployment. The team acknowledged that these changes will require significant updates from client implementers.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted progress toward implementing key features like sharding and data availability sampling (DAS). A new testnet, Ropsten 2.0, was launched for EIP-4844 testing, with encouraging results reported by the development team. The meeting also touched on **client implementation progress**, noting that most clients are making good headway in implementing Base Fee.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** were outlined to ensure timely completion of these critical tasks. Key milestones include:\n\n* Finalizing EIP-4844 implementation details (by April 2022)\n* Completing client updates for London hardfork (by June 2022)\n\nThe meeting concluded with a sense of urgency, emphasizing the need for swift action on these developments to maintain Ethereum's position as a leading smart contract platform."
