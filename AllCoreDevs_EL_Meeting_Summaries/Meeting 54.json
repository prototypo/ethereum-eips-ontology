    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes the introduction of \"blobs\" to improve scalability. The discussion centered around addressing concerns regarding gas costs and potential security implications.\n\nRegarding technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions, the team addressed an ongoing problem with **gas limit adjustments** in certain scenarios. A patch was agreed upon to resolve this issue by adjusting the `MAX_GAS` value when calculating gas limits for transactions. Additionally, a discussion on **memory management optimization** led to proposals for improving memory allocation efficiency.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates highlighted progress toward implementing **Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1**, with several clients reporting significant advancements in their implementation of beacon chain functionality. Notably, the Prysm client has reached an impressive milestone by successfully completing a full cycle through all phases of the consensus protocol. Testing efforts are ongoing to ensure seamless integration and compatibility across various implementations.\n\nClient implementation progress showed that most major clients (Lighthouse, Nethermind, Teku) have made substantial strides in implementing beacon chain functionality. However, some concerns were raised regarding **interoperability testing**, which is crucial for ensuring a smooth transition between different client versions.\n\nAction items assigned during the meeting include finalizing EIP-4848 and conducting thorough security audits on all proposed changes before implementation. The next meeting will focus on reviewing progress toward these goals and addressing any emerging issues or concerns."
