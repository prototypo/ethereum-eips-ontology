    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes the introduction of \"blobs\" to improve scalability. The discussion centered around addressing concerns regarding gas costs and potential security implications.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported in various clients, including Geth (version 1.10.6) and Parity (version 2.7.0). A proposed solution for the Geth bug involved updating the `beacon_chain` module to fix a synchronization issue with the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain.\n\nDevelopment milestones saw progress on implementing **Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1**, with notable updates from Prysmatic Labs and Lighthouse teams regarding their respective client implementations (version numbers not specified). Testing updates included ongoing efforts in simulating large-scale network conditions to stress-test the upcoming upgrade.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed, particularly for Nethermind's Ethereum 2.0 client, which is reportedly nearing completion of its Phase 1 implementation. The team aims to finalize their release by **Q3 <YEAR>**.\n\nAction items and deadlines were outlined, with a focus on addressing outstanding issues before the upcoming upgrade. Notably, the meeting highlighted an impending deadline for EIP-4848's finalization, which is expected to occur within the next two weeks (exact date not specified). The core developers will continue monitoring progress and discussing key developments in subsequent meetings."
