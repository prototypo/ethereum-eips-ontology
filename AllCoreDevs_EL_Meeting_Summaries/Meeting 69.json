    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 69",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of this proposal in reducing gas costs for users who frequently send large amounts of data.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several clients reported encountering problems with **Beacon Chain** synchronization due to an issue related to the `MAX_COMMITTEE_SIZE` parameter. A proposed solution involves adjusting this value to improve performance without compromising security. Additionally, there were discussions about a potential fix for a bug affecting the `geth` client's ability to process certain types of transactions.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, it was announced that **Ethereum 2.0** is on track to reach its next major milestone: the completion of Phase 1.5. This phase involves upgrading the Beacon Chain to support sharding, a key component in Ethereum's transition towards scalability. Testing for this upgrade has been ongoing and is expected to be completed within the next few weeks.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed during the meeting. The `geth` client reported making significant strides in implementing EIP-4848, while other clients like `lighthouse` are working on integrating sharding functionality into their codebase. Action items assigned include finalizing a timeline for Phase 1.5 completion and coordinating with various teams to ensure smooth integration of new features.\n\nOverall, the meeting highlighted ongoing efforts towards improving Ethereum's scalability through EIP-4848 and upgrading its underlying architecture via Phase 1.5."
