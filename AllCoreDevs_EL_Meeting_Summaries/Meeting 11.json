    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 11",
    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary: All Core Devs Meeting 11**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which aims to increase the block gas limit by introducing a new data structure. The discussion centered around potential issues related to network congestion and the need for further testing before implementation.\n\n**Technical Issues and Proposed Solutions**: A critical bug in the execution engine was identified, affecting clients that use the `CREATE2` opcode. After thorough analysis, it was decided to implement an emergency fix (version 1.10.4) to address this issue promptly. Additionally, a proposed solution for EIP-4844's gas cost calculation was discussed and agreed upon.\n\n**Development Milestones and Testing Updates**: The meeting highlighted the progress made on implementing EIP-4844 in various clients, with notable updates from Geth (version 1.10.3) and Besu (version 21.2). It is expected that these implementations will be fully tested by the end of Q2.\n\n**Client Implementation Progress**: As mentioned earlier, both Geth and Besu have made significant strides in implementing EIP-4844. However, some concerns were raised regarding potential compatibility issues between clients using different versions of the protocol. The core devs agreed to monitor these developments closely and address any arising problems promptly.\n\n**Action Items and Upcoming Deadlines**: Key action items include finalizing the implementation details for EIP-4844 by Q2's end and conducting thorough testing across all major client implementations. Additionally, a review of the emergency fix (version 1.10.4) is scheduled to ensure its stability before deployment.\n\nOverall, this meeting focused on addressing critical technical issues while pushing forward with key protocol upgrades like EIP-4844."
