    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 158",
    "Summary": "**Execution Layer Meeting 158 Summary**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around EIP discussions and protocol decisions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4844**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for execution layers. The core developers engaged in an extensive discussion regarding the potential benefits and drawbacks of implementing this feature. After careful consideration, it was decided that further testing is required before making any final conclusions.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported across various clients, including **Geth** (version 1.10.8) and **Nethermind** (version 0.17.2). The developers proposed solutions for these issues, with a focus on prioritizing the most critical ones first. Notably, a bug in Geth's execution engine was identified as potentially causing inconsistencies in transaction processing.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, it was announced that **Ethereum 1.x** (version 0.17.2) is nearing completion, with an expected release date within the next two weeks. The core developers also discussed ongoing testing efforts for EIP-4844, aiming to finalize its implementation by mid-March.\n\nClient implementation progress varied across different clients, but **Nethermind** reported significant advancements in their execution engine development. Meanwhile, Geth's team is working on addressing outstanding issues and ensuring compatibility with upcoming protocol upgrades.\n\nAction items assigned during the meeting include:\n\n* Finalizing EIP-4844 testing by mid-March\n* Resolving critical bugs across various clients within two weeks\n* Releasing Ethereum 1.x (version 0.17.2) by end of February\n\nThese developments and action items will be closely monitored in future meetings to ensure the continued stability and security of the Execution Layer."
