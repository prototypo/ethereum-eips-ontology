    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 167",
    "Summary": "**Execution Layer Meeting 167 Summary**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around Protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4844**, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for execution layer blocks. The core developers engaged in an extensive discussion regarding the potential benefits and drawbacks of implementing this feature, including its impact on scalability and gas costs.\n\nRegarding technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions, several concerns were raised about the stability of certain client implementations under high load conditions. Specifically, **Geth 1.10.8** was identified as having a critical issue that needed to be addressed promptly. The developers also discussed potential fixes for this problem, including patches and workarounds.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, it was reported that the execution layer testnets are progressing steadily towards their target timelines. **Prater**, one of the primary testnets, is expected to reach its next milestone by mid-March with a focus on stress-testing various client implementations under heavy load conditions.\n\nClient implementation progress saw notable advancements in this meeting, particularly for **Nethermind** and **Lighthouse**, which are both making significant strides towards mainnet readiness. The developers also discussed the ongoing efforts of other clients to improve their performance and stability.\n\nAction items assigned during the meeting include a review of EIP-4844 by March 15th and further discussion on addressing Geth's critical issue. Overall, this meeting highlighted the continued focus on scalability improvements through data availability sampling while emphasizing the need for robust client implementations under high load conditions."
