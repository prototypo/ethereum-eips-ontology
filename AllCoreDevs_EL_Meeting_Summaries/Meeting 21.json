    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting Summary**\n\nAt Ethereum Layer 1 core developers' meeting number <MEETING_NUM>, several crucial topics were discussed and addressed. The primary focus was on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team deliberated over proposed changes to improve network scalability, security, and usability.\n\nOne of the key takeaways from these discussions is the ongoing development of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4846, which aims to increase block size limits by introducing a new data structure called \"blobs.\" This change will enable more efficient processing of transactions on the network. The team also discussed EIP-4488, which proposes an upgrade to the proof-of-work consensus algorithm.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues and bugs**, several concerns were raised regarding client implementation progress and testing updates. Notably, a bug in the Geth (Go Ethereum) client was identified that affects its ability to process certain types of transactions correctly. The team agreed on a plan for addressing this issue through an upcoming release.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted significant progress toward implementing EIP-4846 across various clients. For instance, Prysmatic Labs reported making substantial strides in integrating the new data structure into their client implementation. Additionally, several testnets were updated to reflect these changes, allowing developers to begin experimenting with the proposed upgrades.\n\nIn terms of **Action items and upcoming deadlines**, key milestones include a planned release for Geth addressing the identified bug within two weeks' time. Furthermore, an informal deadline was set for implementing EIP-4846 across all major clients by Q2 this year."
