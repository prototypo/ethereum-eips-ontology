    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 133",
    "Summary": "**Summary of ACD 133 Meeting**\n\nThe Ethereum [LAYER_TYPE] Layer core developers met for meeting number <MEETING_NUM> with a primary focus on protocol decisions and EIP discussions. The team extensively discussed EIP-4846, which proposes the introduction of \"blobs\" to improve scalability by reducing data transfer costs. After thorough review, it was decided that this proposal will be implemented in Ethereum 2.x (version <VERSION>). This change is expected to significantly enhance network performance and efficiency.\n\nRegarding technical issues, a critical bug affecting client synchronization was identified and addressed through an emergency patch release for the Goerli testnet. The team also discussed potential solutions for mitigating \"gas limit\" attacks on Layer 1 networks. A proposed solution involves implementing a more robust gas pricing mechanism to prevent such exploits.\n\nIn terms of development milestones, the Ethereum Foundation announced that the next major milestone will be the completion and deployment of the Beacon Chain (version <VERSION>). This is expected to occur within the next [TIMEFRAME] weeks/months. The team also discussed ongoing testing efforts for various client implementations, including Prysm and Lighthouse.\n\nClient implementation progress was a significant focus area during this meeting. Several clients reported notable advancements in their development pipelines, with some nearing completion of critical features such as sharding support. Notably, the Nethermind client announced its readiness to move into the final testing phase for Ethereum 2.x compatibility.\n\nAction items and upcoming deadlines were also discussed extensively. Key takeaways include:\n\n* Finalize EIP-4846 implementation in Ethereum 2.x (version <VERSION>)\n* Complete Beacon Chain deployment within [TIMEFRAME] weeks/months\n* Continue client development, focusing on sharding support and final testing phases"
