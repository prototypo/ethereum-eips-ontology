    "Summary": "**All Core Devs Meeting 137 Summary**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) discussions and protocol decisions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes the introduction of a new data structure called \"blobs\" to improve scalability. The discussion centered around addressing concerns regarding gas costs and potential security implications.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported in various clients, including Geth (version 1.10.11) and Besu (version 21.2.0). A proposed solution for the Geth bug involved updating the `geth` command to include a new flag that would enable users to opt-in to using the latest version of the protocol.\n\nIn terms of development milestones, it was announced that **Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1** (Capella) is expected to be released in Q3 this year, with a focus on improving network security and scalability. The testing team reported progress on implementing the \"Bellatrix\" upgrade, which aims to enhance the protocol's ability to handle high transaction volumes.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed, with notable updates from Prysm (version 2.0.1) and Lighthouse (version v5.3.4). Both clients are working towards supporting the upcoming Bellatrix upgrade.\n\nAction items assigned during this meeting include:\n\n* Finalizing EIP-4848 by **June 15th**\n* Resolving Geth bug by **July 10th**\n* Completing testing for Bellatrix upgrade by **August 1st**\n\nThese deadlines will be crucial in ensuring a smooth transition to the next phase of Ethereum's development."
