The mainnet is expected to be upgraded in 2 weeks' time.\n\nWe need to finalize the testnets for both devnet and mainnet by next week, so we can start testing the new protocol version. This will ensure a smooth transition when it goes live.\n\nThe team has made good progress with implementing the changes required for the hard fork. We are on track to meet our deadline of having everything ready in 2 weeks' time.\n\ncall_12.md\n================\n\nWe discussed the current status of the testnets and mainnet. The devnet is currently running smoothly, but we need to make some adjustments before it can be used as a reliable testing ground for the hard fork.\n\nThe team has been working on implementing the necessary changes in both CL and EL layers. We are making good progress, but there's still much work to be done.\n\nWe have 2 weeks left until the mainnet upgrade. The testnets need to be finalized by then so we can start testing the new protocol version."
