    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes the introduction of \"blobs\" to improve scalability. The discussion centered around addressing concerns regarding gas costs and potential security implications.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported in various clients, including Geth (version 1.10.11) and Parity (version 2.7.0). A proposed solution for the Geth bug involved updating the `beacon_chain` module to fix a synchronization issue with the consensus layer. The team also discussed potential solutions for improving network congestion.\n\nDevelopment milestones were reviewed, highlighting progress on **Ethereum 2.0** implementation and testing updates. Notably, the Merge testnet is expected to be launched in Q3 of this year (2024), pending further review and validation. Client implementation progress was reported across various clients, with Geth leading the pack.\n\nAction items were assigned for several team members regarding EIP-4848's gas cost analysis and potential security risks associated with blobs. The next meeting is scheduled to take place in two weeks' time (Meeting <MEETING_NUM+1>), where further discussion on these topics will be held, along with updates from the Merge testnet launch.\n\nIn summary, this meeting focused primarily on addressing technical issues related to EIP-4848 and client implementation progress. The team is working towards a more scalable Ethereum network while ensuring security considerations are taken into account."
