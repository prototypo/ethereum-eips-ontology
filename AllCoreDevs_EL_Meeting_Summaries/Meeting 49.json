    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of this proposal in terms of scalability improvements.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported across various clients, including Geth and Parity. A proposed solution for one such bug involved updating the `gas_limit` calculation to prevent overflows. Additionally, there was a brief discussion on **EIP-3670**, which aims to introduce an \"access list\" feature that can help reduce gas costs.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, it was noted that the upcoming Berlin hardfork is still scheduled for April 15th with version number `1.10.x`. The team has been working on resolving outstanding issues before this release. Furthermore, there were discussions around **EIP-1559**, which proposes to introduce a new fee market mechanism.\n\nClient implementation progress varied across different clients. Geth reported significant advancements in implementing the proposed changes for EIP-4848 and EIP-3670. Parity also made notable strides but faced some challenges with regards to testing certain features.\n\nAction items assigned during this meeting include finalizing the Berlin hardfork release, resolving outstanding issues related to EIP-1559, and continuing work on client implementation of proposed changes for EIPs 4848 and 3670. The next meeting will focus on reviewing progress made since the last update."
