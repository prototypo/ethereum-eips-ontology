    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 196",
    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary: Execution Layer Meeting 196**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around EIP discussions and protocol decisions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently by the execution layer. The discussion centered around addressing concerns regarding gas costs, security implications, and potential performance benefits.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several clients reported encountering problems with **Beacon Chain** synchronization due to an issue in the `get_block_by_hash` function. A proposed solution was discussed, which involves modifying the client's logic for handling block hashes. The team also acknowledged a minor bug affecting some nodes' ability to process certain types of transactions.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, **Ethereum 2.0** is progressing steadily towards its Phase 1 deployment timeline (Q3/Q4). Testing has been ongoing with the `geth` client, focusing on integration tests for the Beacon Chain and execution layer interactions. The team aims to complete these tests by the end of Q2.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed during this meeting. **Nethermind** reported significant advancements in their EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) implementation, with a focus on improving performance and compatibility with other clients. Meanwhile, **Lighthouse** is working towards integrating support for EIP-4848 into its codebase.\n\nAction items assigned to the team include finalizing the proposed solution for the `get_block_by_hash` issue by Meeting 197 and providing regular updates on client implementation progress."
