    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 198",
    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary: Execution Layer Meeting 198**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around **Protocol Decisions and EIP Discussions**, with a significant emphasis on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which aims to increase the block gas limit by introducing a new data structure called \"Proto-Danksharding.\" The proposal has been under discussion for several months, and core developers continue to refine its implementation. A key decision made during this meeting was to set a target deployment date of Ethereum Protocol Version (EPV) 1.2, which will include the EIP-4844 changes.\n\n**Technical Issues, Bugs, and Proposed Solutions** were also discussed in detail. The team identified several critical bugs affecting client performance, including an issue with gas metering that was causing inconsistent results across different clients. A proposed solution involves updating the gas metering logic to ensure consistency across all implementations. Additionally, developers acknowledged a minor security vulnerability related to the handling of certain types of transactions.\n\n**Development Milestones and Testing Updates** highlighted progress toward implementing EIP-4844 in various client repositories. The Go Ethereum (geth) implementation is ahead of schedule, with version 1.10.23 already incorporating key changes from the proposal. Meanwhile, Parity's development pace has slowed due to resource constraints.\n\nIn terms of **Client Implementation Progress**, geth and Nethermind are leading the charge in implementing EIP-4844. Both clients have made significant strides toward integrating Proto-Danksharding into their codebases. However, other implementations like Besu and OpenEthereum still require substantial work before they can catch up.\n\n**Action Items and Upcoming Deadlines**: The meeting concluded with a clear plan for the next steps in implementing EIP-4844 across various client repositories. Core developers agreed to maintain close communication regarding progress updates and potential roadblocks, ensuring that all stakeholders are informed about any changes or concerns arising from this critical protocol upgrade."
