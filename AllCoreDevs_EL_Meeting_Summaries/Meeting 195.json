    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 195",
    "Summary": "**Execution Layer Meeting 195 Summary**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting was Protocol decisions and EIP discussions. The core developers discussed and finalized several proposals, including **EIP-4846**, which introduces a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" to improve scalability. This proposal aims to reduce the load on execution nodes by allowing them to process transactions more efficiently.\n\nRegarding technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions, the team addressed concerns related to gas pricing and its impact on network congestion. A potential solution involves adjusting the gas limit for certain types of operations, such as data storage. The developers also discussed a bug in the **Beacon Chain** that affects the processing of attestations.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, the meeting covered progress toward implementing EIP-4846 across various clients. Notably, the Go Ethereum (Geth) client has made significant strides in integrating this proposal, with an estimated completion timeline set for Q2 2023. The team also discussed ongoing testing efforts to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nClient implementation progress was another key topic of discussion. The meeting highlighted that most major clients are on track to implement EIP-4846 by the end of H1 2023. However, some concerns were raised regarding potential compatibility issues between different client implementations.\n\nAction items and upcoming deadlines included finalizing the EIP-4846 specification for implementation across all clients. A deadline has been set for **March 15th** to complete this task. The team also agreed on a review process to ensure that any future proposals align with existing protocol decisions, preventing potential conflicts or inconsistencies in client implementations."
