    "Summary": "**Summary of All Core Devs Meeting 93**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which aims to increase the block gas limit by introducing a new type of transaction called \"Proto-Danksharding\". The proposal has been met with both enthusiasm and skepticism from core developers. After an in-depth discussion, it was decided that EIP-4844 will be implemented as part of Ethereum's upcoming Shanghai upgrade (Ethereum 1.x).\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were also discussed at length during the meeting. A critical bug affecting the execution engine was identified and a patch has been submitted for review. Additionally, there have been ongoing discussions regarding the implementation of EIP-1559's \"base fee\" mechanism to improve gas market efficiency.\n\nIn terms of **development milestones and testing updates**, it was reported that the Ethereum 1.x testnet is nearing completion with over 90% of critical components implemented. The team has also made significant progress on integrating the new execution engine, which will enable improved scalability for future upgrades.\n\n**Client implementation progress** showed varied results across different clients, but all are making steady strides towards implementing EIP-4844 and other upcoming features. Notably, Geth is ahead of schedule with its integration efforts.\n\nLastly, **action items and upcoming deadlines** were outlined to ensure timely completion of outstanding tasks. Key milestones include the Shanghai upgrade (Ethereum 1.x) scheduled for Q2 2023 and a comprehensive review of EIP-4844's implementation by mid-March."
