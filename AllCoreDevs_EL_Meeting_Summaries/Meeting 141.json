    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 141",
    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nAt Meeting #141 of Ethereum Layer 1 core developers, several crucial topics were discussed and addressed. The primary focus was on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team deliberated over proposed changes to improve network scalability and security.\n\nOne key discussion centered around EIP-4846 (Proto-Danksharding), which aims to enhance sharding capabilities by introducing a new type of transaction, called \"proto-shards.\" The proposal has been updated to version 2.0, addressing concerns raised during previous meetings. Core devs agreed on the need for further testing and validation before implementing this feature.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, several clients reported ongoing struggles with Byzantium's (EIP-2384) implementation of Revertible Transactions. The team acknowledged that a fix is necessary to prevent potential reentrancy attacks. A patch has been submitted for review, aiming to resolve the issue by Meeting #143.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted progress on implementing EVM 2.0 (EIP-3541) across various clients. This upgrade aims to improve gas efficiency and reduce transaction costs. The team is working towards a soft fork activation in Q3 of this year, with version 1.4.17 being the target implementation.\n\nLastly, **Client implementation progress** showed that most major clients are on track for implementing EIP-4846 (Proto-Danksharding) by Meeting #145. However, some concerns were raised regarding potential compatibility issues between different client implementations of this feature. The team will continue to monitor and address these concerns as the development process unfolds.\n\nAction items assigned during the meeting include:\n\n* Reviewing and testing patches for Revertible Transactions\n* Finalizing EVM 2.0 implementation across clients\n* Addressing Proto-Danksharding compatibility issues\n\nThe next meeting is scheduled for Meeting #143, where core devs will continue to discuss these topics in more detail."
