    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 183",
    "Summary": "**Execution Layer Meeting 183 Summary**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting was Protocol decisions and EIP discussions. The core developers discussed and finalized several proposals, including **EIP-4846**, which aims to improve scalability by introducing a new type of transaction called \"blobs\". This proposal is expected to be implemented in the upcoming Berlin hardfork (version 1.2). Another key discussion centered around **EIP-3675**, which introduces a mechanism for sharding, allowing multiple chains to share the same execution environment.\n\nTechnical issues and bugs were also addressed during this meeting. The developers identified several critical vulnerabilities that need immediate attention, including an issue with gas metering in smart contracts. A proposed solution involves updating the contract's bytecode to accurately track gas usage. Additionally, a bug related to transaction ordering was discussed; it is expected to be resolved by implementing a new algorithm for sorting transactions.\n\nClient implementation progress and development milestones were also covered during this meeting. The developers reported that most clients are on track with their implementations of EIP-4846 and EIP-3675. However, some concerns arose regarding the compatibility between different client versions; it is recommended to test extensively before deploying these updates in production environments.\n\nAction items assigned include reviewing and finalizing the implementation details for both proposals by **March 21st** (version 1.2). The developers also agreed on conducting thorough testing of EIP-4846, focusing particularly on its interaction with existing smart contracts."
