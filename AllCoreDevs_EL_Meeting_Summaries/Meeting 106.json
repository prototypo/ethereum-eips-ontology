    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 106",
    "Summary": "**Summary of All Core Devs Meeting 106**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which aims to increase the block gas limit by introducing a new data structure called \"Proto-Danksharding\". The proposal has been under review since Meeting 104, and after thorough discussion, it was decided that further testing is required before moving forward. A tentative timeline for completion of this EIP's implementation was set at approximately two weeks.\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were also discussed in detail during the meeting. The team identified a critical bug affecting the execution engine, which has been causing inconsistencies with gas metering. After analyzing the issue, it was determined that an update to the `gasmeter` module is necessary to resolve this problem.\n\nRegarding **development milestones and testing updates**, the team reported progress on implementing EIP-4844 in various client implementations (Goerli testnet). The Goerli testnet has been upgraded with a new version of the Ethereum protocol, which includes support for Proto-Danksharding. This milestone marks an essential step towards mainnet deployment.\n\n**Client implementation progress** was also discussed during the meeting. Most clients have implemented EIP-4844 successfully on their respective testnets (Goerli and Rinkeby). However, some minor issues were reported with regards to gas metering consistency across different client implementations.\n\nLastly, **action items and upcoming deadlines** include finalizing testing for Proto-Danksharding implementation in the next meeting. The team will also continue working towards resolving outstanding technical issues related to EIP-4844's execution engine integration."
