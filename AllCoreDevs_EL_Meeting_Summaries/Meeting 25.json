    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 25",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting #25 focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4848 (Base Fee Upgrade). The proposal aims to improve the efficiency of transactions by introducing a new type of data structure called \"blob\" which will be stored in a separate area of memory. This upgrade is expected to reduce gas costs for users and increase scalability.\n\nIn terms of technical issues, several bugs were reported across various clients, including Geth (v1.10.6) and Parity (v2.7.0). The team discussed proposed solutions, with some consensus on implementing a fix in the upcoming release cycle. Additionally, there was an update on the development milestone for Ethereum 2.0's Phase 3, which is expected to be completed by Q4 of this year.\n\nClient implementation progress showed that most clients are now compatible with EIP-1559 (London Hardfork), scheduled for deployment later in August. The team also discussed testing updates and agreed upon a plan to conduct thorough stress tests on the upcoming hard fork.\n\nAction items were assigned, including finalizing the Base Fee Upgrade proposal by the end of this week and conducting additional security audits before deploying EIP-1559. Notably, there was some concern raised regarding potential gas price manipulation post-London Hardfork deployment; however, no concrete solutions or mitigation strategies have been proposed yet.\n\nOverall, while several key developments were discussed during meeting #25, it appears that the team is making steady progress toward implementing critical upgrades and resolving technical issues affecting Ethereum's scalability."
