    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 185",
    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nAt Meeting 185 of the Ethereum Execution Layer core developers, several crucial topics were discussed and addressed. The primary focus was on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team deliberated over proposed changes to improve network scalability and security.\n\nOne key discussion centered around EIP-4846 (Proto-Danksharding), which aims to enhance sharding capabilities by introducing a new type of transaction, called \"proto-shards.\" The developers debated various aspects, including gas costs, data availability, and the impact on existing clients. After thorough consideration, they decided to proceed with implementing proto-danksharding in Ethereum 2.0.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, several concerns were raised regarding client compatibility and performance optimization for upcoming hardforks (Ethereum 1.x). The team discussed potential fixes and workarounds to mitigate these issues, ensuring a smoother transition for users.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** revealed that the Ethereum 2.0 Phase 3 deployment is on track, with an expected launch in Q4 of this year. Additionally, the developers reported progress toward implementing EIP-4846, aiming for its inclusion in Ethereum 1.x hardforks later this quarter.\n\nLastly, **Client implementation progress** showed notable advancements from various client teams (e.g., Lighthouse and Prysm). The team acknowledged these efforts but emphasized ongoing challenges related to compatibility and performance. To address these concerns, the developers assigned several action items with specific deadlines for review and testing of proposed solutions."
