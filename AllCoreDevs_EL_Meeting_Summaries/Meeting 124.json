    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 124",
    "Summary": "**All Core Devs Meeting 124 Summary**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around EIP discussions and protocol decisions, with a significant emphasis on **Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844**, which aims to increase the block gas limit by introducing a new data structure. The proposal has garnered substantial interest among core developers, with several key concerns raised regarding its potential impact on network congestion.\n\nRegarding technical issues, the team discussed ongoing efforts to resolve a critical bug in **Geth** (version 1.10.11) that causes nodes to crash when processing certain types of transactions. A proposed patch was presented and is currently being reviewed by core developers for inclusion in an upcoming release. Additionally, there were discussions around potential solutions for mitigating the effects of network congestion on Ethereum's scalability.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, it was reported that **Beacon Chain** (version 1.4) has been successfully deployed to testnets with a focus on stress-testing its performance under heavy loads. This milestone marks significant progress towards enabling sharding in Ethereum 2.0. Furthermore, the team discussed ongoing efforts to integrate **Optimism's L2 solution**, which is expected to provide substantial scalability improvements.\n\nClient implementation progress was also highlighted during this meeting, with notable updates from **Nethermind** and **Lighthouse** regarding their respective implementations of EIP-4844. Action items assigned include reviewing the proposed patch for Geth and providing feedback on Optimism's L2 solution integration by the next scheduled meeting (Meeting 125)."
