    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 155",
    "Summary": "**Execution Layer Meeting 155 Summary**\n\nThe core developers discussed several critical topics during this meeting, with a primary focus on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions** (Ethereum Improvement Proposals). The team reviewed and finalized the implementation of EIP-4848, which introduces a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" to improve scalability. This update is expected to be included in Ethereum's upcoming Berlin hardfork (version 12.1) scheduled for April 15th.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, the team addressed several concerns related to gas pricing and metering. A new proposal was introduced to modify the gas cost model to better handle complex transactions. The developers also discussed a potential fix for a long-standing issue with transaction reordering, which could lead to improved network stability.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** were also covered during this meeting. The team reported progress on implementing EIP-1559 (London hardfork), expected in July 2022. Additionally, the development of Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm is ongoing, with a focus on improving network security.\n\nThe **Client implementation progress** was reviewed for several popular clients, including Geth and Parity. The team noted that most clients are now implementing EIP-4848 in preparation for Berlin hardfork. However, some concerns were raised regarding the compatibility of certain client implementations with upcoming protocol changes.\n\nFinally, the meeting concluded with a review of **Action items and upcoming deadlines**. Key tasks include finalizing the implementation of EIP-1559 and completing testing for the London hardfork by June 2022. The team also agreed to schedule an additional meeting in April to discuss ongoing development progress and address any emerging issues related to Berlin's release."
