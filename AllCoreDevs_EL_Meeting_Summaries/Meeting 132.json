    "Summary": "**All Core Devs Meeting 132 Summary**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around EIP discussions and protocol decisions, with a significant emphasis on **Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844**, which aims to increase the block gas limit by introducing a new data structure. The proposal has garnered substantial interest among developers, with several key stakeholders weighing in on its potential impact.\n\nRegarding technical issues, the team discussed ongoing problems related to **gas pricing and estimation**. A proposed solution involves revising the `gasPrice` field in transactions to better reflect actual gas costs. This change is expected to improve user experience by reducing confusion around transaction fees.\n\nIn terms of development milestones, the meeting highlighted progress on implementing EIP-4844 across various client implementations (e.g., **Geth 1.10.8** and **Nethermind 0.7.2-alpha**). Testing updates indicated that several clients are nearing completion of their respective implementation tasks. Notably, a new testing framework has been proposed to streamline the process.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed, with an emphasis on ensuring compatibility across different client versions (e.g., Geth and Nethermind). The team acknowledged concerns regarding potential **backward incompatibilities** but expressed confidence that these issues can be addressed through careful planning and coordination.\n\nAction items assigned during this meeting include:\n\n* Finalizing EIP-4844 implementation details by the next meeting\n* Developing a testing framework for evaluating client compatibility\n\nThe upcoming deadline is set at two weeks, with regular check-ins to monitor progress."
