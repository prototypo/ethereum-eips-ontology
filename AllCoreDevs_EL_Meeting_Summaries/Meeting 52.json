    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting #52 focused primarily on protocol decisions, technical issues, and client implementation progress. A notable discussion revolved around **ProgPOW**, a proposed algorithm to mitigate ASIC mining dominance in the network. The team decided to adopt ProgPOW with an expected deployment timeline of Q1 2020 (Decision 1).\n\nRegarding EIP discussions, there was no significant update on new proposals or implementations during this meeting. However, it is worth noting that **BLS signature** specification has been published and requires peer review within the next two to three weeks (Action Item 5). This development aims to enhance security features in Ethereum's upcoming hard fork.\n\nIn terms of technical issues and bugs, there were no major concerns raised during this meeting. Nevertheless, it is essential for developers to continue monitoring client implementations and reporting any potential problems promptly.\n\nClient implementation progress was a significant focus area at the meeting. The team discussed updates from various clients, including **Geth**, **Parity Ethereum**, and others (Agenda Item 2). While no specific milestones were mentioned in this summary, it is crucial for developers to stay informed about client development status as they directly impact network stability.\n\nAction items assigned during the meeting include:\n\n* Hudson+ PM team to resume publishing Hard Forks announcements on Ethereum.org\n* Afri to work on HF Roadmap (Action Item 4)\n* Dany Need spec peer review and provide feedback in the next two to three weeks\n\nOverall, this meeting highlighted ongoing efforts towards enhancing network security through ProgPOW adoption and BLS signature implementation."
