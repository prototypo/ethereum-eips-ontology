    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 161",
    "Summary": "**Execution Layer Meeting 161 Summary**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around Protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4844**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently than traditional transactions. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of increased scalability and reduced gas costs.\n\nRegarding technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions, several clients reported encountering difficulties with the recent protocol upgrade **Berlin Hardfork (EIP-2565)**. Specifically, Parity client developers noted a bug that caused incorrect handling of certain transaction types. The team is working on resolving this issue to ensure seamless integration with other clients.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates highlighted progress toward implementing EIP-4844 in various clients. Go Ethereum reported making significant strides in integrating the new protocol feature, while Nethermind client developers are close to completing their implementation. Testing has been ongoing across multiple testnets, including Ropsten and Rinkeby.\n\nClient implementation progress showed that most major clients have successfully integrated Berlin Hardfork (EIP-2565). However, some minor issues were reported with the Parity client's integration of EIP-4844 due to the aforementioned bug. The team is working diligently to resolve these problems before the next protocol upgrade.\n\nAction items and upcoming deadlines include finalizing the implementation of EIP-4844 across all major clients by **Q2 2023**. Additionally, a review session for proposed changes in the Execution Layer will take place within the next two weeks to ensure that any updates align with existing protocols and do not introduce new security risks.\n\nOverall, this meeting demonstrated significant progress toward implementing key protocol upgrades while addressing technical issues as they arise."
