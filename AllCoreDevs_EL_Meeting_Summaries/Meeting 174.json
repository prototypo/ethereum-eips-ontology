    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 174",
    "Summary": "**Summary of Execution Layer Meeting 174**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where core developers discussed several proposals related to Ethereum's execution layer, specifically around sharding and scalability enhancements. Notably, the discussion centered on EIP-4848 (Base Fee Upgrade), which aims to improve gas efficiency by introducing a new type of transaction called \"blobs.\" The proposal has been updated to version 2.0, addressing concerns raised in previous meetings.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, several clients reported ongoing struggles with sharding-related problems, including difficulties with shard data propagation and synchronization. To address these challenges, developers are working on implementing a new \"shard sync\" mechanism that will enable more efficient communication between shards. Additionally, the team is exploring ways to improve gas metering for blob transactions.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted several notable achievements in recent weeks. The Goerli testnet has been upgraded with sharding capabilities, allowing developers to experiment with shard-based deployments. Furthermore, a new version of the Geth client (v1.11) is nearing release, featuring improved support for EIP-4848.\n\nIn terms of **Client implementation progress**, several clients reported significant advancements in their implementations of sharding and blob transactions. The Besu client has made notable strides in integrating with other shards, while Nethermind's team continues to work on optimizing its shard synchronization mechanism.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** include a review of EIP-4848 v2.0 by the end of November 2023, followed by a formal proposal submission for inclusion in Ethereum's next protocol upgrade cycle (Shapella)."
