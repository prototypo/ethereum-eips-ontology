    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 51",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting #51 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting #51 focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of this proposal in reducing gas costs for users and improving scalability.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several clients reported encountering problems related to **Beacon Chain** synchronization with the Ethereum mainnet. Specifically, Geth 1.10.x versions were found to have a bug that caused inconsistent state between the Beacon Chain and the execution layer. The team is working on resolving this issue through patches.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, it was announced that **Ethereum 2.0** (Serenity) is progressing steadily towards its target release date in Q3 2021. Testing has been ongoing for several months now, with a focus on ensuring the Beacon Chain's compatibility with various client implementations.\n\nClient implementation progress saw notable advancements from Prysm and Lighthouse clients, which are both actively contributing to Ethereum 2.0 development. The team is working closely together to ensure seamless integration between different components of the network.\n\nAction items for upcoming deadlines include finalizing EIP-4848 by **June 15th**, resolving Beacon Chain synchronization issues with Geth versions prior to 1.10.x, and continuing testing efforts towards Serenity's release date in Q3 2021."
