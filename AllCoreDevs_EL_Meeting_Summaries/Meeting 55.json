    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of this proposal in terms of scalability improvements.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several clients reported encountering problems related to **gas pricing** inconsistencies across different implementations. A proposed solution involves revising the gas price calculation algorithm to ensure consistency among all nodes. Additionally, a bug affecting the handling of **uncle headers** was identified and is being addressed by developers.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, several clients are nearing completion of their implementation of the upcoming Berlin hardfork (Ethereum 1.1.0). The testnet for this release has been activated to facilitate further testing before its scheduled deployment on April 15th. Notably, **Geth** is currently lagging behind other implementations in terms of progress.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed during the meeting. Several clients reported making significant strides towards implementing EIP-4848 and are working closely with each other to ensure a smooth transition once it's activated. The action items assigned include revising gas price calculations, addressing uncle header bugs, and finalizing client implementations for Berlin hardfork.\n\nThe next meeting is scheduled for [insert date] when the team will reconvene to discuss ongoing progress on EIP-4848 implementation across clients and finalize preparations for the upcoming hardfork."
