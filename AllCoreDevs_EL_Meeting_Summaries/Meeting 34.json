    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes the introduction of \"blobs\" to improve scalability. The discussion centered around addressing concerns regarding gas costs, security implications, and potential interactions with other upcoming upgrades like sharding.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several clients reported progress in resolving outstanding problems. For instance, Geth developers announced a fix for the **CVE-2022-2935** vulnerability, while Besu contributors made significant strides in addressing memory safety concerns. The meeting also touched on proposed solutions to mitigate potential congestion caused by upcoming upgrades.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates revealed that several clients are nearing completion of their sharding implementations. For example, Geth's sharding prototype is expected to be fully functional within the next two weeks, while Besu aims to complete its implementation in approximately six weeks' time. The meeting also highlighted ongoing efforts to improve test coverage for various client components.\n\nClient implementation progress was another key area discussed during the meeting. Several clients reported significant advancements in their implementations of upcoming upgrades like EIP-4848 and sharding. Notably, Geth's developers announced plans to merge a major update (version 1.10) within the next two weeks, which will include several critical bug fixes.\n\nAction items assigned from this meeting included reviewing and finalizing proposals for EIP-4848 by **<DATE>** and conducting thorough testing of sharding implementations across various clients. The upcoming deadline for these tasks underscores the importance of timely progress toward Ethereum's scalability upgrades."
