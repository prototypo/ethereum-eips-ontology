    "Summary": "**Summary of Meeting #129**\n\nThe Ethereum Core Developers' Meeting #129 focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on the upcoming Shanghai upgrade (Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559). The meeting saw extensive discussion around the implementation details for the proposed changes to the gas pricing mechanism. After thorough deliberation, it was decided that the new gas price formula would be implemented as planned.\n\nTechnical issues and bugs were also discussed during the meeting. A critical bug in the Ethereum protocol's difficulty adjustment algorithm (EIP-1559) was identified by developers from Nethermind and Prysmatic Labs. The issue has been acknowledged, and a patch is being worked on to address it before the Shanghai upgrade goes live.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates were also covered during the meeting. It was reported that the Goerli testnet had reached 90% completion of its scheduled upgrades for EIP-1559 implementation. Additionally, developers from various teams shared their progress in implementing the new gas pricing mechanism across different client implementations (e.g., Geth, Besu).\n\nClient implementation progress showed promising results with most clients on track to meet the Shanghai upgrade deadline. However, some concerns were raised regarding potential compatibility issues between certain client versions and the upgraded protocol.\n\nAction items assigned during the meeting include finalizing EIP-1559's gas pricing formula for deployment in February 2022 (Shanghai hardfork) and addressing the difficulty adjustment bug before its implementation. The next meeting will focus on reviewing progress made towards these objectives, ensuring a smooth transition to the Shanghai upgrade."
