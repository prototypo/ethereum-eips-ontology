    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 168",
    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nAt Meeting 168 of Ethereum Execution Layer core developers, several crucial topics were discussed and addressed. The primary focus was on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team deliberated over proposals for improving network scalability and security.\n\nOne notable discussion centered around EIP-4846 (Proto-Danksharding), which aims to enhance sharding capabilities by introducing a new type of transaction, called \"proto-dank shards.\" The proposal has been updated to version 2.0, addressing concerns raised during the previous meeting. After thorough review and debate, the team agreed on moving forward with implementing EIP-4846 v2.0.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, several client-specific problems were reported and discussed. For instance, a bug in Geth's (version 1.10.8) handling of transaction reordering was identified and assigned to the team for resolution. Additionally, discussions around improving error reporting mechanisms across clients continued.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted progress on implementing EIP-4846 v2.0 within various client implementations. The Go Ethereum (Geth) client is expected to reach a milestone with its implementation of proto-dank shards by the end of Q1 2023, while other clients are working towards similar timelines.\n\nLastly, **Action items and upcoming deadlines** were outlined for core developers. Key tasks include finalizing EIP-4846 v2.0 documentation, resolving outstanding client-specific issues, and conducting thorough testing before implementing proto-dank shards in production environments. The next meeting is scheduled to review progress on these action items and address any emerging concerns or challenges.\n\nOverall, Meeting 168 marked significant strides towards enhancing Ethereum's scalability and security capabilities through the implementation of EIP-4846 v2.0."
