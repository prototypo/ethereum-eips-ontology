    "Summary": "**Execution Layer Meeting 170 Summary**\n\nThe core discussion at Execution Layer Meeting 170 centered around Protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4844**, also known as \"Proto-Danksharding\". This proposal aims to improve the scalability of Ethereum by introducing a new type of transaction that can be processed in parallel. The meeting saw active discussion among developers regarding the implementation details, including concerns about gas costs and potential security implications.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several clients reported ongoing struggles with **Geth's** (version 1.10.x) memory leak issue, which has been a persistent problem for months. A proposed solution was discussed but not finalized due to disagreements on its feasibility. Additionally, there were reports of minor inconsistencies in the behavior of different client implementations.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates revealed that several clients are nearing completion of their **EIP-4844** implementation. For instance, Prysm (version 1.0.x) is expected to have a working prototype by the end of Q2 this year. However, there were concerns raised about the lack of comprehensive testing for these new features.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed during the meeting. Several clients reported making significant strides in implementing EIP-4844, with some even achieving partial success. Nevertheless, it's essential to note that a unified client implementation is still pending due to differences in approach and timeline expectations among developers.\n\nAction items assigned from this meeting include finalizing the proposed solution for Geth's memory leak issue by Meeting 175 (in two weeks) and ensuring all clients have working EIP-4844 implementations within Q3."
