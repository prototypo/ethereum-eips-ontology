    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 177",
    "Summary": "**Execution Layer Meeting 177 Summary**\n\nThe core developers discussed several crucial topics during Execution Layer Meeting 177. The primary focus was on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where they reviewed and finalized a proposal for implementing the \"Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844: Sharding\" in Ethereum's execution layer. This upgrade aims to significantly enhance scalability by introducing sharded data structures, allowing for more efficient processing of transactions.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, developers addressed several critical concerns related to gas pricing mechanisms and the potential impact on network congestion. They also discussed a bug fix for the \"difficulty bomb\" issue, which is expected to be resolved in the upcoming Berlin hardfork (Ethereum 1.x version: 12.0). Additionally, they explored ways to mitigate the effects of high-gas-price attacks.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted several notable achievements. The team has made significant progress on implementing EIP-4844's sharding functionality in various client implementations, including Geth (version 1.10) and Besu (version 21.2). Testing is ongoing to ensure seamless integration with the existing protocol.\n\nIn terms of **Client implementation progress**, developers reported that most clients are now compatible with the upcoming Berlin hardfork. However, some minor issues were identified in the testing phase, which will be addressed before the final release.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** include completing EIP-4844's sharding integration across all client implementations by Meeting 180 (target date: April 15th). The team also plans to finalize a gas pricing mechanism proposal for review at the next meeting."
