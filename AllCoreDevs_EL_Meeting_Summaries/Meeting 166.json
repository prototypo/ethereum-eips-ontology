    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 166",
    "Summary": "**Execution Layer Meeting 166 Summary**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4848, also known as \"Proto-Danksharding.\" The core developers discussed the latest implementation status, addressing concerns regarding gas costs and block size limitations. A consensus was reached to proceed with further testing and refinement of this proposal.\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were another key area of discussion. Notably, a bug in the execution engine's handling of recursive function calls was identified and addressed through an update to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This fix is expected to be included in the upcoming release of Geth 1.11.0.\n\nIn terms of **development milestones and testing updates**, it was announced that the \"Berlin\" hardfork, scheduled for April 2022, will include several key upgrades, including EIP-1559's London upgrade components. The core developers also discussed ongoing efforts to improve test coverage and automate more aspects of the development process.\n\n**Client implementation progress** showed significant advancements across various clients, with Geth leading the pack in terms of adoption rates (over 70% market share). Parity and Besu are catching up rapidly, however, with notable improvements in their respective implementations. The meeting concluded with a review of **action items and upcoming deadlines**, including a call to action for all client developers to prioritize EIP-4848 testing.\n\nOverall, this meeting highlighted the ongoing efforts towards improving Ethereum's scalability through Proto-Danksharding (EIP-4848) while addressing technical issues and pushing forward development milestones."
