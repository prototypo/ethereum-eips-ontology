    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 28",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of this proposal in terms of scalability improvements.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported across various clients, including Geth and Parity. A proposed solution for one such bug involved updating the `gas_limit` calculation to prevent overflows. Additionally, there was a brief review of **Ethereum 2.0's** (Beacon Chain) recent upgrade to version **Altair**, which introduced several improvements in terms of security and efficiency.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, it was noted that the next major milestone for Ethereum 2.0 is scheduled for Q1 <YEAR>, with a focus on completing the final stages of Beacon Chain deployment. Testing has been ongoing to ensure seamless integration between the Beacon Chain and existing clients like Geth and Parity.\n\nClient implementation progress saw notable advancements in **Geth's** support for EIP-4848, which will enable more efficient processing of blobs transactions once implemented. Meanwhile, **Parity's** development team is working on integrating a new caching mechanism to improve performance.\n\nAction items assigned during the meeting include reviewing and finalizing proposals for upcoming protocol upgrades by <DATE> and conducting thorough testing across various clients before deployment."
