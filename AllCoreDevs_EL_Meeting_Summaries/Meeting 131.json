    "Summary": "**All Core Devs Meeting 131 Summary**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around EIP discussions and protocol decisions, with a significant emphasis on **Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4846**, which aims to increase the block gas limit by introducing a new data structure. The proposal has garnered substantial interest among developers, with several key stakeholders weighing in on its potential impact.\n\nRegarding technical issues, the team discussed ongoing efforts to resolve the \"difficulty bomb\" issue, which is expected to occur around **Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1** (Berlin). This problem arises from a gradual increase in difficulty over time, causing network congestion and decreased security. The developers are working on implementing a solution that will mitigate this effect.\n\nIn terms of development milestones, the team reported progress toward completing the implementation of EIP-4846 across various client implementations. **Go Ethereum** (geth) is currently leading the charge with an estimated completion timeline set for Q2 2023. Meanwhile, other clients such as **Nethermind**, are expected to follow suit in subsequent quarters.\n\nClient implementation updates revealed that several teams have made significant strides toward integrating EIP-4846 into their respective codebases. Notably, geth has already implemented the new data structure and is conducting thorough testing to ensure its stability.\n\nAction items for this meeting included finalizing a timeline for implementing EIP-4846 across all client implementations by **Q3 2023**. Additionally, developers were tasked with providing regular updates on their progress toward resolving technical issues related to difficulty bomb mitigation."
