    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 180",
    "Summary": "**Execution Layer Meeting 180 Summary**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting was Protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4844**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently than traditional transactions. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of increased scalability and reduced gas costs for users.\n\nRegarding technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions, several clients reported ongoing efforts to address **memory leak** concerns in their implementations. Notably, Geth developers are working on a patch (version 1.10.8) that aims to resolve this issue by the end of Q2. Additionally, discussions around **gas pricing mechanisms** continued, with some participants advocating for more flexible and adaptive models.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates highlighted progress toward implementing EIP-4844 in various clients. For instance, Besu developers reported making significant strides (version 21.1) in integrating the new transaction type, while Prysmatic Labs is working on a testnet deployment to further validate its performance. Client implementation progress also included discussions around **interoperability** and ensuring seamless communication between different client implementations.\n\nAction items and upcoming deadlines were discussed briefly, with several participants agreeing to provide updates by Meeting 185 (in two weeks). Notably, the Ethereum Foundation will be hosting a workshop on EIP-4844 in late Q2 to facilitate further discussion and collaboration among developers. Overall, this meeting underscored ongoing efforts toward improving scalability and efficiency within the Execution Layer ecosystem.\n\nIn conclusion, while several technical challenges persist, progress is being made toward implementing key upgrades that can significantly enhance user experience and network performance."
