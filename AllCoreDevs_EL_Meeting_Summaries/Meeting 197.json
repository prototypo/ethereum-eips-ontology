    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 197",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting 197 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting 197 focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4848, also known as \"Proto-Danksharding.\" This proposal aims to improve the scalability of the network by introducing a new type of transaction that can be processed more efficiently. The discussion centered around the implementation details, including the choice of data structure for the proto-dank shard and the impact on gas costs.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several clients reported encountering problems with the recent protocol upgrades (Berlin Hardfork). Specifically, Geth experienced a bug related to the `EIP-1559` upgrade, which was promptly addressed by the developers. The meeting also touched upon ongoing development milestones and testing updates for upcoming hard forks, including the Paris Hardfork scheduled for April 2023.\n\nClient implementation progress showed that most clients are on track with implementing EIP-4848, although some minor issues were reported during testing. Notably, Besu has made significant strides in integrating proto-danksharding capabilities into its codebase. The meeting concluded with a review of action items and upcoming deadlines for the various client teams to finalize their implementations.\n\nIn terms of notable changes or concerns, it was mentioned that the Ethereum Foundation will be providing additional resources to support the development and testing efforts leading up to the Paris Hardfork. This includes dedicated funding for bug bounties and increased personnel assistance from experienced developers. Overall, meeting 197 highlighted significant progress toward improving scalability on the Ethereum network while also addressing pressing technical issues.\n\nAction items assigned during this meeting include:\n\n* Finalizing EIP-4848 implementation details by March 15th\n* Conducting thorough testing of proto-danksharding capabilities across all clients before the Paris Hardfork\n\nThese action items will be crucial in ensuring a smooth transition to improved scalability and addressing any potential issues that may arise."
