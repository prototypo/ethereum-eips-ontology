    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 119",
    "Summary": "**Summary of All Core Devs Meeting 119**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4848, also known as \"Proto-Danksharding\". The proposal aims to improve the scalability of Ethereum by introducing a new type of transaction that can be processed more efficiently. After thorough discussion, it was decided to move forward with implementing this feature in the upcoming Berlin hardfork (Ethereum 1.x version: v0.9.2). This decision is expected to significantly enhance the network's capacity and reduce congestion.\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were also extensively discussed during the meeting. A critical bug affecting the gas metering of certain operations was identified in the current implementation (Ethereum 1.x version: v0.9.2). The team agreed to prioritize fixing this issue as soon as possible due to its potential impact on user experience and network stability.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted progress towards implementing EIP-1559, which aims to improve gas price dynamics by introducing a base fee for transactions (Ethereum 1.x version: v0.10.2). The team is working diligently to ensure that this feature meets the required standards before its deployment.\n\nIn terms of **client implementation progress**, several clients reported significant advancements in implementing EIP-4848 and other upcoming features. Notably, Prysmatic Labs' client has made substantial strides towards integrating Proto-Danksharding into their codebase (Client version: v1.0.3).\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** were also discussed during the meeting. The team agreed to prioritize fixing the aforementioned gas metering bug within two weeks and to continue working on implementing EIP-1559 in a timely manner."
