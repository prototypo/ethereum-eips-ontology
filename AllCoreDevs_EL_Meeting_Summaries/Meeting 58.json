    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 58",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes the introduction of \"blobs\" to improve scalability. The discussion centered around addressing concerns regarding gas costs and potential security implications.\n\nRegarding technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions, the team addressed several pressing matters. Notably, they discussed the ongoing efforts to resolve a critical issue with **Ethereum 2.0's** (Beacon Chain) **deposit contract**, which has been causing delays in the transition process. The developers also explored potential fixes for a bug affecting gas metering on the Beacon Chain.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, the team reported progress toward implementing **Shapella**, the upcoming merge between Ethereum 1.x (execution layer) and Ethereum 2.0 (consensus layer). Key components, such as the execution engine and consensus protocol integration, are nearing completion. Testing has been ongoing to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed, with notable updates from **geth** and **Nethermind**, two prominent client implementations. Both clients have made significant strides in implementing Shapella features, including support for EIP-4848 blobs.\n\nAction items and upcoming deadlines were outlined during the meeting. The team emphasized the importance of resolving outstanding issues before the merge activation date (TBD). Key action items include finalizing deposit contract fixes, completing testing on Beacon Chain components, and addressing gas cost concerns related to EIP-4848."
