    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes the introduction of \"blobs\" to improve scalability. The discussion centered around addressing concerns regarding gas costs and potential security implications.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several clients reported progress in resolving outstanding problems. For instance, **Geth 1.10.7** has been released with a fix for a critical bug affecting transaction processing efficiency. Meanwhile, Parity's team is working on implementing the \" blob\" functionality as part of their upcoming release.\n\nDevelopment milestones were also discussed during the meeting. The Ethereum Foundation announced that they are targeting a **September launch date** for the Shanghai hardfork, which will include EIP-4848 and other improvements to enhance network performance. Additionally, several clients reported progress in implementing the \"difficulty bomb\" delay as part of their upcoming releases.\n\nClient implementation progress was another key area discussed during the meeting. Geth's team is working on integrating a new caching mechanism to improve transaction processing efficiency, while Parity's team is focusing on optimizing their client for better performance under high loads.\n\nAction items and deadlines were also covered in detail. The Ethereum Foundation emphasized that all clients must implement EIP-4848 by **August 1st** to ensure a smooth transition during the Shanghai hardfork. Furthermore, several action items were assigned to individual team members regarding testing updates and client implementation progress."
