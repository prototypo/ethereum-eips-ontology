    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 87",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Developer Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developer community gathered for MEETING_NUM to discuss crucial updates and decisions affecting the protocol's development trajectory. **Protocol Decisions and EIP Discussions**: The meeting centered around discussions on proposed changes to the gas limit, with a focus on implementing a more adaptive mechanism (EIP-4488). This change aims to mitigate congestion issues during high-demand periods.\n\n**Technical Issues, Bugs, and Proposed Solutions**: A critical bug in the Ethereum 1.10 release was identified, affecting the execution of certain smart contracts. The team collaborated to develop a patch, which is expected to be deployed within the next two weeks (targeting version 1.11). Additionally, discussions around improving gas pricing mechanisms continued, with potential solutions involving more accurate estimates and dynamic adjustments.\n\n**Development Milestones and Testing Updates**: Progress on implementing EIP-1559 was reported, with significant advancements in testing and validation. The team is working towards a mid-April release (version 1.12) that incorporates this protocol upgrade. Meanwhile, the development of Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm continues to advance, with ongoing research into its implementation.\n\n**Client Implementation Progress**: Notable updates were shared regarding client implementations, including Parity and Geth. Both clients are actively working on integrating EIP-1559 and PoS features. The meeting highlighted the importance of continued collaboration between these teams to ensure seamless integration across different client versions (1.10.x).\n\n**Action Items and Upcoming Deadlines**: Key action items include finalizing the adaptive gas limit mechanism, deploying the 1.11 patch, and completing EIP-1559 testing by mid-April. The community emphasized the need for continued coordination among developers to meet these deadlines and ensure a smooth transition towards Ethereum's next major protocol upgrade."
