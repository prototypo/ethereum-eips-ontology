    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 121",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting Summary**\n\nThe recent Ethereum Execution Layer core developers' meeting (Meeting #121) focused on several critical topics that will shape the future of the network. **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions** took center stage, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4844, which proposes to introduce data availability sampling for improved scalability. The discussion centered around its implementation details, including gas costs and potential performance benefits.\n\nRegarding **technical issues**, several bugs were reported in various clients, including Geth (v1.10.11) and Nethermind (v0.9.2). A proposed solution was presented to address a critical issue affecting the execution engine's ability to handle large transaction sets efficiently. The fix is expected to be implemented soon.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted notable progress in client implementation, with Geth nearing completion of its EIP-4844 integration (targeting v1.11 release). Nethermind also made significant strides, achieving a 30% increase in test coverage for the upcoming v0.10 release. The meeting emphasized the importance of thorough testing to ensure seamless deployment.\n\n**Client implementation progress** revealed that Prysm and Lighthouse are working on integrating EIP-4844 as well, with expected completion dates set for Q2 this year. This widespread adoption will significantly enhance Ethereum's scalability capabilities.\n\nThe meeting concluded with **action items and upcoming deadlines**, including a review of the proposed fix for the execution engine bug by March 15th (Meeting #122) and an update on EIP-4844 implementation progress in April. These developments underscore the collaborative effort among core developers to drive forward key improvements, ultimately enhancing Ethereum's performance and usability."
