    "Summary": "**Summary of All Core Devs Meeting 103**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which aims to increase the block gas limit by introducing a new data structure called \"Proto-Danksharding.\" The discussion centered around its implementation timeline, with a proposed activation date of Shanghai hardfork. Core devs also discussed potential issues related to EVM bytecode and caching.\n\n**Technical Issues and Proposed Solutions**\n\nSeveral technical concerns were raised during the meeting, including an issue affecting Ethereum 1.x clients due to incorrect handling of `SSTORE` operations in certain scenarios. A patch was proposed by a core dev, which is expected to be implemented soon. Additionally, there was discussion around fixing a bug related to gas metering for EVM bytecode.\n\n**Development Milestones and Testing Updates**\n\nThe meeting covered updates on the development progress of various Ethereum clients, including Geth (version 1.10.8) and Besu (version 21.2). Core devs also discussed testing plans for upcoming releases, with a focus on ensuring compatibility across different client implementations. Notably, there was mention of an ongoing effort to improve test coverage and reduce the number of failing tests.\n\n**Action Items and Upcoming Deadlines**\n\nKey action items from this meeting include implementing EIP 4844 in Geth and Besu clients by Shanghai hardfork activation date (expected around April-May). Core devs also agreed on a deadline for resolving outstanding technical issues, with regular check-ins to track progress. Overall, the meeting highlighted ongoing efforts towards improving Ethereum's scalability and security features through protocol upgrades and client development."
