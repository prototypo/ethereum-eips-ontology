    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nAt Meeting #148 of Ethereum Layer 1 core developers, several crucial topics were discussed and addressed. The primary focus was on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team deliberated over proposals for improving network scalability and security.\n\nNotably, a discussion around **EIP-4846: Blob Storage** took center stage. This proposal aims to introduce a new type of transaction that can store large amounts of data off-chain, thereby reducing congestion on the main chain. The core devs debated its implementation details, including gas costs and storage limits. A consensus was reached to move forward with implementing EIP-4846 in Ethereum 2.0.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues**, several bugs were reported across various clients (e.g., Geth v1.10.8). These included a fix for the \"difficulty bomb\" issue, which had been causing network instability. The team also discussed proposed solutions to address ongoing concerns around gas pricing and transaction throughput.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted progress on Ethereum 2.0's Beacon Chain (version 1.4.5) and Merge preparations. Testing has shown promising results for the upcoming merge, with a focus on ensuring seamless transitions between Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS). The team also discussed plans to increase testing frequency in anticipation of mainnet deployment.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** included finalizing EIP-4846 implementation details by Meeting #150. Additionally, the core devs agreed on a timeline for Beacon Chain version 1.5 release within the next two weeks."
