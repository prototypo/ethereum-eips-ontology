    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 182",
    "Summary": "**Execution Layer Meeting 182 Summary**\n\nThe core discussion at Execution Layer Meeting 182 centered around Protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4844**, also known as \"Proto-Danksharding\". This proposal aims to improve the scalability of Ethereum by introducing a new type of transaction that can be processed more efficiently. The meeting saw active discussion among developers regarding the implementation details, including concerns about gas costs and potential security implications.\n\nIn terms of Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions, several clients reported ongoing struggles with **Beacon Chain synchronization** due to inconsistent block propagation times between nodes. A proposed solution involves adjusting the `MAX_COMMITTEE_SIZE` parameter in the Beacon Chain configuration file. Additionally, a bug was identified in the Geth client's handling of `EIP-1559` transactions.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates highlighted progress on **execution layer sharding**, with several clients reporting successful tests using simulated shard chains. However, concerns were raised about the lack of clear guidelines for implementing EVM (Execution Environment) modifications across different shards. The meeting also touched upon upcoming deadlines for client implementation of `EIP-4844`, with a target deployment date set for **Q2 2023**.\n\nAction items and upcoming deadlines included finalizing the Beacon Chain configuration file adjustments to address synchronization issues, as well as scheduling an additional testing session for execution layer sharding. The meeting concluded with reminders about ongoing client implementation progress tracking on GitHub and regular updates from core developers regarding EIP discussions and technical developments."
