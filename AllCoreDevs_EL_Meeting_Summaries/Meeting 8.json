    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 8",
    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nIn Meeting 8 of Ethereum Core Devs, several crucial topics were discussed and addressed. The primary focus was on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team deliberated over proposed changes to improve network scalability and security.\n\nOne key discussion centered around EIP-4846 (Proto-Danksharding), which aims to enhance sharding capabilities by introducing a new type of transaction, called \"proto-dank shards.\" The proposal has been updated with version 2.0, addressing concerns raised in previous meetings regarding gas costs and network congestion. A consensus was reached on implementing EIP-4846 as part of the upcoming Shanghai hardfork (scheduled for April).\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, a critical bug affecting the execution engine's ability to handle certain types of transactions was identified and assigned to be fixed by the end of March. Additionally, discussions around improving network congestion management through more efficient data propagation were initiated.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted progress on implementing EIP-4846 in various client implementations (e.g., Geth v1.10.8). The team also discussed plans for a comprehensive testnet deployment to validate the proposed changes before their mainnet rollout.\n\nLastly, **Action items and upcoming deadlines** were outlined, including:\n\n* Finalizing EIP-4846 implementation by March 31st\n* Conducting thorough testing of proto-dank shards on testnets starting April 1st\n* Reviewing client implementations for compliance with the updated protocol specifications\n\nThese developments are crucial steps towards enhancing Ethereum's scalability and security. The team will continue to monitor progress, address any arising issues, and ensure a smooth transition to the new protocol features in Shanghai hardfork."
