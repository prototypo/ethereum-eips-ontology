    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 175",
    "Summary": "**Execution Layer Meeting 175 Summary**\n\nThe core discussion at Execution Layer Meeting 175 centered around Protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4844**, also known as \"Proto-Danksharding\". This proposal aims to improve the scalability of Ethereum by introducing a new type of transaction that can be processed more efficiently. The meeting saw active discussion among developers regarding the implementation details, including concerns about gas costs and potential security implications.\n\nRegarding technical issues and bugs, several clients reported ongoing struggles with **Geth's** (version 1.10.x) memory leak issue, which has been a persistent problem for months. A proposed solution was discussed but not finalized due to conflicting opinions on the best approach. Another notable bug is affecting **Nethermind**, where developers are working to resolve an issue causing incorrect gas refunds.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates were also covered during the meeting. The team reported progress towards implementing EIP-4844, with a target deployment date set for Q2 2023 (subject to change). Testing has been ongoing, but some clients have encountered issues due to incomplete or inconsistent implementation of new features.\n\nClient implementation progress was another key topic at this meeting. **Besu** developers announced they are working on implementing EIP-4844 and expect a beta release soon. Meanwhile, the **Nethermind** team is still addressing their gas refund bug but expects to catch up with other clients in terms of feature parity within the next few weeks.\n\nAction items from this meeting include finalizing the implementation details for EIP-4844 by the end of Q1 2023 and resolving outstanding technical issues. The upcoming deadline will be crucial, as it may impact Ethereum's scalability roadmap if not met on time."
