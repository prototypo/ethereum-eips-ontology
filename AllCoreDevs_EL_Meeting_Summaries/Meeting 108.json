    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 108",
    "Summary": "**Summary of All Core Devs Meeting 108**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which aims to increase the block gas limit by introducing a new data structure called \"Proto-Danksharding.\" The proposal has been met with both enthusiasm and skepticism among core developers. After thorough discussion, it was decided that further testing is required before making any decisions.\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were also extensively discussed during this meeting. A critical bug in the Ethereum 2.0 client implementation (version `mainnet`-v1.10) affecting gas metering has been identified and a patch is being developed to address it. Additionally, there was an update on the ongoing efforts to resolve issues related to the \"difficulty bomb\" mechanism.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted several notable achievements in recent weeks. The Ethereum 2.0 client implementation (version `mainnet`-v1.10) has been successfully tested with a large number of validators, marking an important milestone towards mainnet deployment. Furthermore, there was progress on the development of new tools for monitoring and testing purposes.\n\n**Client implementation progress** showed that most clients are now aligned in terms of their Ethereum 2.0 client implementations (version `mainnet`-v1.10). However, some minor discrepancies remain to be addressed before a unified mainnet deployment can occur.\n\nThe meeting concluded with several **action items and upcoming deadlines**, including the completion of EIP4844 testing by the end of this week and further discussion on the difficulty bomb mechanism in an upcoming meeting."
