    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 157",
    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nAt Meeting 157 of Ethereum Execution Layer core developers, several crucial topics were discussed and addressed. The primary focus was on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team deliberated over proposed changes to improve scalability and security.\n\nOne key discussion centered around EIP-4848 (Proto-Danksharding), which aims to enhance sharding capabilities by introducing a new type of transaction, Proto-Shard Transactions (PSTs). The proposal has been updated with version 2.0, incorporating feedback from the community. A consensus was reached on implementing PSTs in Ethereum's execution layer.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues and bugs**, several concerns were raised regarding gas costs for certain operations within EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) contracts. It was proposed to adjust these costs by introducing a new opcode or modifying existing ones, which would help mitigate potential DoS attacks. The team agreed on further investigation into this matter.\n\nIn terms of **Development milestones and testing updates**, the meeting highlighted progress toward implementing Ethereum's upcoming hard fork (London). Specifically, it mentioned that client implementations for EIP-1559 are nearing completion, with Goerli testnet being used as a proving ground for finalizing these changes. The team also discussed plans to conduct thorough security audits before the mainnet deployment.\n\n**Action items and deadlines** were assigned to several participants regarding implementation of specific features and testing protocols. Notably, an upcoming deadline was set for client implementations to finalize their EIP-1559 support by April 15th."
