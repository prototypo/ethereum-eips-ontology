    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes the introduction of \"blobs\" to improve scalability. The discussion centered around addressing concerns regarding gas costs and potential security implications.\n\nRegarding technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions, the team addressed several pressing matters. Notably, they discussed an issue affecting Ethereum 2.0's **Beacon Chain** (version `altair-v1`), where a bug was identified in the implementation of the \"sync committee\" mechanism. A fix has been implemented and is currently undergoing testing.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, the team reported progress on several fronts. The Ethereum 2.0 client **Lighthouse**, developed by Sigma Prime, reached version `v5.1`, marking significant advancements in its implementation. Additionally, a new testnet for Ethereum 2.0's Beacon Chain was launched to facilitate further testing.\n\nClient implementation progress saw notable updates from various teams. Prysmatic Labs' **Prysm** client (version `v3.4`) reported improvements in performance and stability. Meanwhile, the Lighthouse team announced plans to integrate a new \" sync committee\" mechanism into their codebase.\n\nAction items and upcoming deadlines were also discussed during the meeting. The team set an ambitious target for implementing EIP-4848 by **Q2 2023**, with several milestones outlined along the way. Notably, they emphasized the need for thorough testing to ensure a smooth rollout of this critical upgrade."
