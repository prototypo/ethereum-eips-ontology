    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently. The discussion centered around the potential benefits and drawbacks of implementing this feature, including its impact on scalability and gas costs.\n\nIn terms of technical issues, several bugs were reported in various clients, with **Geth** experiencing an issue related to incorrect handling of uncle headers. A proposed solution was discussed, which involves updating the client's logic for processing uncle headers. Additionally, a bug in **Parity**'s implementation of the `EIP-1559` gas pricing mechanism was identified and is being addressed.\n\nDevelopment milestones were also covered during the meeting. The team reported progress on implementing **Shanghai**, the next Ethereum hardfork, which aims to improve scalability and reduce costs for users. A tentative timeline has been set with a target deployment date of Q2 2023. Furthermore, testing updates indicated that several clients are nearing completion of their Shanghai implementation.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed during the meeting. **Geth** reported significant advancements in implementing EIP-4848, while **Parity** is working on resolving issues related to its gas pricing mechanism. Action items and upcoming deadlines were outlined for each client, with a focus on completing Shanghai implementations by Q2 2023.\n\nOverall, this meeting highlighted the ongoing efforts of Ethereum core developers to improve scalability, reduce costs, and enhance user experience through protocol upgrades and bug fixes."
