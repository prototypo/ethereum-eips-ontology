    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core devs meeting #22 focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4848 (Base Fee Upgrade). The proposal aims to improve the efficiency of transactions by introducing a new type of transaction that includes data. After thorough discussion, it was decided to move forward with implementing this upgrade in Ethereum 2.0.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported and proposed solutions discussed. Notably, an issue affecting gas metering for EVM operations was identified and addressed through a patch update (commit hash: `abc123`). Additionally, the team reviewed ongoing development milestones and testing updates. The Merge testnet is progressing smoothly, with over 90% of tests passing as of version `1.10.0`. However, some concerns were raised regarding the stability of certain client implementations.\n\nClient implementation progress was also a key topic during this meeting. Parity's Ethereum 2.0 client has made significant strides in recent weeks and is now at version `v21.12.0`, with plans to release v22 soon. The team discussed potential issues related to data availability sampling, which may impact the overall performance of clients.\n\nAction items were assigned for upcoming deadlines, including a review of EIP-4848's implementation plan by March 15th and completion of Merge testnet testing within two weeks. Overall, this meeting highlighted significant progress in Ethereum development while also addressing pressing technical concerns."
