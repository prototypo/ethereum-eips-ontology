    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 77",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" to improve scalability. The discussion centered around the potential benefits and drawbacks of implementing this feature, including its impact on gas costs and network congestion.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported in various clients, with notable mentions being **Geth 1.10.11** and **Parity 2.7.0-beta**, which are experiencing memory leaks under certain conditions. Proposed solutions include updating the affected code to improve resource management. Additionally, there was a discussion on addressing an issue related to **gas limit calculations in EVM execution**, with potential fixes being explored.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, it was reported that the Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1 testnet is nearing completion, with plans for its launch expected soon (targeting Q3). The team also discussed progress on implementing **Beacon Chain's shard proposal** in various clients, aiming to improve overall network efficiency.\n\nClient implementation progress showed significant advancements across multiple implementations, including Geth and Parity. Notably, the discussion highlighted ongoing efforts to address compatibility issues between different client versions (e.g., EVM version 1.2).\n\nAction items assigned during this meeting include reviewing **EIP-4848** for potential inclusion in a future release and addressing outstanding bugs reported across various clients. The next scheduled meeting will focus on further discussing the implementation of Beacon Chain's shard proposal, with an emphasis on resolving any remaining technical hurdles.\n\nOverall, while several pressing issues were discussed, progress toward implementing key scalability features remains steady, reflecting ongoing efforts to enhance Ethereum's performance and usability."
