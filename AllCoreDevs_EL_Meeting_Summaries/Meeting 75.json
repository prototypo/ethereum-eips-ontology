    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 75",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum All Core Devs Call <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe recent Ethereum All Core Developers call focused on several critical topics, with a primary emphasis on protocol decisions and EIP discussions. The team extensively debated the implementation of EIP-4848 (Base Fee Upgrade), which aims to improve scalability by introducing a new type of transaction called \"blobs.\" After thorough discussion, it was decided that the upgrade will proceed as planned for Shanghai hardfork (~April 2023). This decision is expected to significantly enhance Ethereum's capacity and efficiency.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported in various clients. Notably, Geth (v1.11) encountered a problem with gas estimation, while Besu (v21.4.0) faced an issue related to transaction reordering. The team collaborated on proposed solutions for these problems, ensuring that they will be addressed before the Shanghai hardfork.\n\nIn terms of development milestones and testing updates, it was announced that the Goerli testnet would undergo a scheduled upgrade in March 2023 (v9). This update is crucial as it prepares the network for future upgrades. Additionally, several clients are nearing completion of their implementation of EIP-1559 (London hardfork), which will introduce a new fee market and improve overall transaction efficiency.\n\nClient implementation progress was also discussed during the call. Most notable were updates from Geth and Besu regarding their respective implementations of EIPs 4848 and 1559. The team is working diligently to ensure that all clients are aligned with upcoming protocol changes, guaranteeing a seamless transition for users.\n\nAction items assigned include finalizing client implementation details by March 2023 (v9) and conducting thorough testing before the Shanghai hardfork in April 2023."
