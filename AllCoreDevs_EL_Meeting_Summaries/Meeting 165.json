    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary**\n\nAt Meeting 165 of Ethereum Execution Layer core developers, several crucial topics were discussed and addressed. The primary focus was on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team deliberated over proposals for improving network scalability and security.\n\nOne key discussion centered around EIP-4488 (Proportional Resilience), which aims to enhance the resilience of Ethereum's consensus mechanism by introducing a new type of block proposal. The developers debated various aspects, including its impact on existing clients and potential implementation challenges. After thorough consideration, they decided to proceed with implementing this protocol upgrade.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, several concerns were raised regarding client compatibility and the integration of recent EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals). The team discussed a few reported bugs in popular clients like Geth and Parity, and developers agreed on patches for these issues. Additionally, they reviewed ongoing efforts to resolve long-standing problems with gas pricing.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** were also covered during the meeting. It was announced that the next major release of Ethereum's Execution Layer (Ethereum 2.0) is scheduled for Q3 this year, pending successful completion of several critical tasks. The team reviewed progress on these objectives, including improvements to client interoperability and enhancements in network performance.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** were outlined at the end of the meeting. Key responsibilities included finalizing EIP-4488 implementation details by the next week's deadline and conducting thorough testing for all clients involved."
