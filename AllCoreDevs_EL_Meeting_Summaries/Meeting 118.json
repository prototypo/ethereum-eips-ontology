    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 118",
    "Summary": "**Summary of All Core Devs Meeting 118**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the team extensively discussed EIP-4848, a proposed upgrade to improve Ethereum's scalability through data sharding. The discussion centered around addressing concerns regarding gas costs, security implications, and potential performance benefits. After thorough deliberation, it was decided that further testing is required before making any final decisions.\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were also discussed in detail during the meeting. A critical bug affecting the execution of certain smart contracts on Goerli testnet (version 1.10.4) was identified and reported by a core developer. The team collaborated to propose a fix, which is currently being reviewed for implementation.\n\nRegarding **development milestones and testing updates**, it was announced that the next major release, version 2.0, will be delayed due to ongoing EIP-4848 discussions and other technical complexities. However, the development of testnets (Goerli and Rinkeby) continues with a focus on improving their stability and performance.\n\n**Client implementation progress** showed significant advancements in various client implementations, including Besu (version 21.2.0), Geth (version 1.10.4), and Nethermind (version 1.3.5). These updates have improved overall network efficiency and security.\n\nLastly, **action items and upcoming deadlines** were outlined for the next meeting. Key tasks include finalizing EIP-4848 testing results, addressing outstanding technical issues, and preparing for a potential release of version 2.0 in Q4 this year."
