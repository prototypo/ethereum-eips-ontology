    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 95",
    "Summary": "**Summary of All Core Devs Meeting 95**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4848, also known as \"Proto-Danksharding\". The proposal aims to improve the scalability of Ethereum by introducing a new type of transaction that can be processed more efficiently. After thorough discussion, it was decided to move forward with implementing this feature in the upcoming Berlin hardfork (Ethereum 1.x version: v0.7.5). This decision is expected to significantly enhance the network's capacity and reduce congestion.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, several concerns were raised regarding the stability of certain client implementations under high load conditions. The team discussed potential fixes for these issues, including adjustments to gas limits and improvements in memory management. Additionally, a bug was identified in the implementation of EIP-1559 (London hardfork), which will be addressed before its scheduled deployment.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted progress on implementing various features, such as improved transaction ordering and enhanced debugging tools. The team also discussed plans for integrating new testnets to facilitate more comprehensive testing and validation of upcoming changes.\n\nIn terms of **Client implementation progress**, several clients reported advancements in their implementations of EIP-4848 and other proposed features. Notably, the Geth client has made significant strides in implementing Proto-Danksharding, with a functional prototype already available for testing.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** include finalizing the Berlin hardfork release (targeted for Q2 2021) and completing EIP-4848 implementation across all clients. The team also agreed to schedule an additional meeting before the next major update to ensure smooth deployment of these new features."
