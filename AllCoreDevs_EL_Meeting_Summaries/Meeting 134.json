    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 134",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes the introduction of data availability sampling to improve scalability. The discussion centered around addressing concerns regarding gas costs and potential security implications.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported in various clients, including Geth (version 1.10.11) and Parity (version 2.7.0). A proposed solution for one such bug involved updating the `keccak256` function to use a more efficient algorithm. The meeting also touched upon ongoing development milestones, with an update on **Shapella**, the upcoming Shanghai/Cape Town hardfork scheduled for April 2023.\n\nClient implementation progress was discussed in detail, particularly regarding the integration of EIP-4848 into various clients. Parity's lead developer reported that their team is making good progress toward implementing the proposed changes. Meanwhile, Geth developers are working on addressing performance issues related to data availability sampling.\n\nAction items and upcoming deadlines were also covered during the meeting. The core devs agreed upon a deadline of March 2023 for finalizing EIP-4848 implementation in various clients. Additionally, they set aside time for reviewing and testing **Ethereum 2.0** client implementations before the Shanghai/Cape Town hardfork.\n\nOverall, this meeting highlighted significant progress toward improving Ethereum's scalability through data availability sampling while addressing technical concerns and development milestones."
