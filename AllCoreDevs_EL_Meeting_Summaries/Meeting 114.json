    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 114",
    "Summary": "**Summary of All Core Devs Meeting 114**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) related to sharding, specifically EIP-4844 and its variants. The discussion centered around the need for more robust testing and validation of these proposals before implementation. It was agreed that further research is required to ensure seamless integration with existing protocols.\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were also a key topic, particularly regarding the ongoing issue with gas limit adjustments in EIP-1559. The team discussed potential fixes and their implications on network performance. Additionally, there were updates on addressing memory safety vulnerabilities in Ethereum clients, with some progress reported but more work needed to ensure complete mitigation.\n\nRegarding **development milestones and testing updates**, it was announced that the next major milestone for sharding implementation is scheduled for Q2 2023 (Ethereum Improvement Proposal EIP-4844). This will involve a comprehensive review of all related code changes. Furthermore, there were discussions on improving test coverage and automation to ensure smoother integration with future protocol upgrades.\n\n**Client implementation progress**, specifically regarding the development of sharding-enabled clients, was also discussed in detail. The team acknowledged that significant work remains but expressed optimism about meeting upcoming deadlines due to recent advancements in client-side testing infrastructure.\n\nLastly, **action items and upcoming deadlines** were outlined for further discussion on EIP-4844 variants and gas limit adjustments. Key stakeholders are expected to provide updates by the end of Q1 2023 (Ethereum Improvement Proposal EIP-1559)."
