    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 48",
    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes to introduce a new type of transaction called \"blobs\" that can be processed more efficiently. The discussion centered around the potential benefits of this proposal in reducing gas costs for users and improving scalability.\n\nRegarding technical issues, several bugs were reported across various clients, including Geth (version 1.10.8) and Parity (version 2.7.0). A proposed solution to address these issues involves implementing a new consensus algorithm called \"Capella\" that would improve the overall security of the network. The development team is working on integrating this feature into future releases.\n\nIn terms of client implementation progress, **Geth** has made significant strides in incorporating EIP-4848 and Capella features. Meanwhile, Parity's developers are focusing on resolving outstanding issues related to gas pricing and transaction processing times. Testing updates indicate that both clients have shown improvements in performance metrics since the last meeting.\n\nAction items for upcoming deadlines include finalizing the implementation of EIP-4848 across all client implementations by **Q2 2023**. Additionally, a review of Capella's consensus algorithm is scheduled to take place within the next two weeks. The development team will continue monitoring progress and addressing any emerging concerns or issues.\n\nOverall, this meeting highlighted significant advancements in protocol decisions and technical developments that aim to enhance Ethereum's scalability and security features."
