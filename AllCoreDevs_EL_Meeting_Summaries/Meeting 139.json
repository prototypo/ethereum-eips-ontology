    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting 139 Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting #139 focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4848 (Base Fee Upgrade). The proposal aims to improve the efficiency of transactions by introducing a new type of transaction that can be processed in parallel. After thorough discussion, it was decided to move forward with implementing this upgrade as part of Ethereum's upcoming Shanghai hardfork.\n\nTechnical issues and bugs were also addressed during the meeting. A critical bug affecting the Geth client implementation was identified and assigned for resolution. The team is working on a fix that should be available in the next major release (Geth v1.11). Additionally, discussions around EIP-3675 (Difficulty Bomb Delay) continued, with some concerns raised regarding its potential impact on network security.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates were also covered during the meeting. The Shanghai hardfork is scheduled for April 2023, with a focus on implementing several key upgrades, including EIP-4848 and EIP-3669 (Gas Cost Update). Testing has been ongoing to ensure smooth integration of these changes into various client implementations.\n\nClient implementation progress was reported by major clients such as Geth, Parity, and Besu. The meeting highlighted the importance of continued collaboration among developers to maintain compatibility across different client versions. Action items were assigned for each team member responsible for implementing specific EIPs or resolving technical issues.\n\nThe next Ethereum core devs meeting is scheduled in two weeks' time, with a focus on reviewing progress made since this meeting and addressing any new concerns that may arise from ongoing development efforts."
