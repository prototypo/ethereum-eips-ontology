    "Summary": "**All Core Devs Meeting 107 Summary**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which aims to increase the block gas limit by introducing a new data structure called \"Proto-Danksharding.\" The proposal has garnered substantial interest among developers, with some expressing concerns about its potential impact on network scalability. After thorough discussion and debate, it was decided that EIP-4844 will be implemented in Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5.\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were also a key topic of conversation. The team discussed the ongoing issue with \"The Merge\" (Ethereum 2.0's transition to proof-of-stake), specifically focusing on the need for improved error handling mechanisms in Beacon Chain nodes. A potential solution was proposed involving the implementation of a new data structure, but further discussion and testing are required before any decisions can be made.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted significant progress toward The Merge, with several clients reporting successful testnet runs using Ethereum 2.0's Phase 1.5 protocol. Notably, Prysmatic Labs' client achieved a notable milestone by successfully completing the first phase of its \"Merge\" tests on the Goerli test network.\n\nIn terms of **client implementation progress**, Lighthouse and Teku clients reported advancements in their respective implementations of EIP-4844. However, concerns were raised regarding potential compatibility issues between these clients and other components within The Merge ecosystem.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** include a scheduled review of the Beacon Chain's error handling mechanisms by the end of Q2 2023 and continued testing of Phase 1.5 protocol implementations across various client teams."
