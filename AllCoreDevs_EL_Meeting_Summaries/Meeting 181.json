    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 181",
    "Summary": "**Execution Layer Meeting 181 Summary**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) discussions and protocol decisions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4846**, which aims to improve the execution layer's performance by introducing a new type of transaction called \"blobs.\" The proposal has reached an advanced stage, with several clients implementing it. A key discussion point was the need for more testing and validation before its activation.\n\nRegarding technical issues, the team addressed **a critical bug in the Geth client**, which affects version 1.10.x. The issue is related to a memory leak that can cause nodes to run out of resources over time. A patch has been proposed and will be reviewed by the community soon. Additionally, there were discussions around optimizing the execution layer's performance, including **the use of parallel processing** for certain tasks.\n\nIn terms of development milestones, the team is working towards a **February 2024 activation date for EIP-4846**, pending further testing and validation. The clients implementing this proposal are making good progress, with several already supporting it in their latest versions (e.g., Geth v1.11.x). Testing updates were also discussed, including plans to conduct more extensive stress tests on the execution layer.\n\nClient implementation progress was another key topic of discussion. Several clients have made significant strides in implementing EIP-4846, while others are still working towards full support. Action items and upcoming deadlines include reviewing the proposed patch for Geth's memory leak bug and finalizing testing plans before the activation date.\n\nOverall, this meeting highlighted the ongoing efforts to improve the execution layer's performance through protocol changes like EIP-4846. The team is making steady progress on addressing technical issues and implementing new features, with a focus on ensuring stability and security throughout the process."
