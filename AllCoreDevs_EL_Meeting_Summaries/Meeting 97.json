    "Meeting": "Execution Layer Meeting 97",
    "Summary": "**Summary of All Core Devs Meeting 97**\n\nThe primary focus area for this meeting was **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which aims to increase the block gas limit by introducing a new data structure called \"Proto-Danksharding\". The proposal has been met with both enthusiasm and skepticism among core developers. After thorough discussion, it was decided that further testing is required before making any decisions.\n\n**Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions** were also discussed at length. A critical bug in the Ethereum 2.0 client's consensus layer was identified and a patch was agreed upon to be implemented as soon as possible. Additionally, there have been ongoing discussions about addressing gas costs for certain operations, with some developers advocating for changes to the current pricing model.\n\nIn terms of **development milestones and testing updates**, it was reported that the Ethereum 2.0 client is progressing steadily towards its next major milestone: Phase 1.5 deployment on testnets. The team has been working diligently to address outstanding issues and ensure a smooth transition to this new phase.\n\n**Client implementation progress** showed significant advancements, with several clients reporting successful testing of key features such as sharding and beacon chain integration. However, some concerns were raised regarding the pace of development for certain components.\n\nThe meeting concluded with **action items and upcoming deadlines**, including further review of EIP 4844 by a working group and implementation of the bug fix in the consensus layer client. The next All Core Devs Meeting is scheduled to take place within two weeks, where these developments will be revisited and progress assessed."
