    "Summary": "**Ethereum Core Devs Meeting <MEETING_NUM> Summary**\n\nThe Ethereum core developers' meeting focused primarily on protocol decisions and EIP discussions, with a significant emphasis on **EIP-4848**, which proposes the introduction of a new data structure called \"blobs\" to improve scalability. The discussion centered around addressing concerns regarding gas costs and potential security implications.\n\nRegarding technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions, the meeting highlighted ongoing efforts to resolve the **difficulty bomb** issue, which is expected to be addressed in Ethereum 2.0's upcoming Bellatrix upgrade (version 1.10). Additionally, developers discussed a fix for a critical bug affecting the Geth client implementation.\n\nDevelopment milestones and testing updates were also covered during the meeting. The team reported progress on implementing **Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1**, with several clients nearing completion of their respective testnets. Notably, Prysmatic Labs' Beacon Chain is expected to reach a milestone in its development timeline by Q3 this year.\n\nClient implementation progress was another key area discussed during the meeting. The Lighthouse client has made significant strides and is now capable of producing blocks on the mainnet. However, concerns regarding **validator incentives** were raised due to potential issues with reward distribution post-merge.\n\nAction items and upcoming deadlines included a review of EIP proposals by September 15th and completion of Phase 1 testing within Q3 this year. The meeting concluded with an emphasis on addressing outstanding technical challenges while pushing forward with the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade roadmap."
