    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary - All Core Devs Meeting 10**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting revolved around **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, with a significant emphasis on EIP-4848, also known as \"Proto-Danksharding.\" This proposal aims to improve the scalability of Ethereum by introducing a new type of transaction that can be processed more efficiently. The discussion centered around its implementation details, including the choice of gas pricing model for these transactions and how they will interact with existing smart contracts.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, several clients reported encountering difficulties in implementing certain aspects of EIP-4848 due to compatibility concerns or missing functionality. For instance, Geth developers mentioned that their implementation was facing challenges related to the gas pricing model for Proto-Dankshard transactions. The team discussed possible workarounds and agreed on a plan to address these issues.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted progress in implementing EIP-4848 across various clients. Parity reported making significant strides, with an estimated completion timeline of 2 weeks from the meeting date (March 10th). Geth developers also provided an update on their implementation status, indicating that they were about to start internal testing.\n\nIn terms of **Client implementation progress**, all major clients are actively working towards implementing EIP-4848. Parity and Besu reported making notable strides in this regard. However, the discussion highlighted concerns regarding potential compatibility issues between different client implementations.\n\n**Action items and upcoming deadlines** included a review of the current state of Proto-Danksharding implementation across various clients by March 17th to ensure that all parties are on track with their timelines. Additionally, developers agreed to provide regular updates on EIP-4848's progress in future meetings."
