    "Summary": "**Meeting Summary: Execution Layer Meeting 179 [2024-01-18]**\n\nThe primary focus of this meeting was on **Protocol decisions and EIP discussions**, where the core developers discussed potential changes to the execution layer protocol. Notably, they revisited the topic of **EIP-4848 (Base Fee Upgrade)**, with a proposed timeline for implementation in Ethereum 2.0's Shanghai upgrade (~June 2024). The discussion centered around addressing concerns regarding gas costs and user experience.\n\nRegarding **Technical issues, bugs, and proposed solutions**, several clients reported ongoing efforts to resolve the \"difficulty bomb\" issue affecting some nodes' ability to sync with the network. A potential fix was discussed, involving a temporary adjustment of difficulty targets until the next protocol upgrade. Additionally, developers acknowledged an existing bug in the execution layer's gas metering system.\n\n**Development milestones and testing updates** highlighted progress on implementing EIP-4848 in various clients (e.g., Prysm v2.3.0). The meeting also touched upon upcoming **Client implementation progress**, with several teams sharing their development roadmaps for the Shanghai upgrade, including plans to integrate new features like sharding.\n\nLastly, the core developers assigned a few key action items and set deadlines: \n\n* Finalize EIP-4848 specification by end of January\n* Schedule an emergency meeting if difficulty bomb fix is not implemented in time\n\nThese updates reflect ongoing efforts towards improving Ethereum's execution layer protocol."
